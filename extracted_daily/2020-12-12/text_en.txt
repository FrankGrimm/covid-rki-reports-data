   The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
   data were not recorded regularly.
   COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
   Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
   situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

     Summary (as of 12/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
     • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
         encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
     • Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 163 cases per 100,000
         population. In Saxony it is more than twice as high; in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, Saarland and Thuringia,
         it is markedly above the overall incidence.
     • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
         incidence of people ≥60 years is currently 150 cases/100,000 population.
     • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 4 districts have an incidence of ≤25
         cases/100,000 population. In comparison, 328 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
         42 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
     • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
         households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to
         religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
     • With 4,491 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.
     • On 11/12/2020, 28,438 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as
         496 new deaths associated with COVID-19.
     • RKI’s risk assessment was updated. RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population as very high.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 12/12/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the increase could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since 04/12/2020 case numbers are sharply increasing again.
      Since a few days the R-value is increasingly above 1. This means that, on average, each person infected
      with SARS-CoV-2 infects a little more than one other person. As the number of infected persons is
      currently very high in Germany, this results in a high and increasing number of new infections every day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly
      in households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and
      educational settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2
      without traceable transmission chains.
      While the 7-day-incidence among younger age groups is stable or slightly decreasing, the incidence
      among older people is further increasing. As the latter more often have more severe illness due to
      COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent
      the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,300,516
  (+28,438) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 708,122 cases (54%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (12/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (408 of 412). There are 42 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 2 districts with an
  incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows the
  incidence for all districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                         4-day R-value                                                             7-day R-value
                                1.15                                                                     1.17
        (95%-prediction interval: 0.96 – 1.35)                                      (95%- prediction interval: 1.05 – 1.30)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 12/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 08/12/2020).
    Since a few days the R-value is increasingly above 1. This means that, on average, each person infected
    with SARS-CoV-2 infects a little more than one other person. As the number of infected persons is
    currently very high in Germany, this results in a high and increasing number of new infections every day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 12/12/2020, a total of 1,290 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,042
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,156 (82%) are occupied, and 4,886 (18%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
     situation on 11/12/2020. The RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population
     as very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as
     the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and senior care
     homes. Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of
     vulnerable groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new
     infections can be substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
