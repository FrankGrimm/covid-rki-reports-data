COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 28/07/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    In the past few weeks, the number of districts that have not reported any COVID-19 cases over a
          period of 7 days has decreased clearly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal
          states. This trend is concerning.
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 4.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 95 districts transmitted zero
          cases over the past 7 days. Moreover, in 223 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5,0/100,000
          inhabitants.
     •    In total, 206,242 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,122 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >150
          cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company. The entire company with over 450
          employees is under quarantine.
     •    Currently, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including meat-processing plants,
          facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, nursing homes and hospitals as well as in context of
          families or religious events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 28/07/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      An increase in COVID-19 case numbers since last week occurred in many of the federal states, but was
      most marked in Bavaria and Northrhine Wetphalia. Case numbers have increased considerably again
      today following somewhat lower case numbers due to testing and reporting delays on the two week-
      end days.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case clusters in different administrative districts in various settings,
      such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and health
      facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning from
      travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since last week. This development is very
      concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also in outdoor
      settings, airing indoor areas and, where necessary, wearing a community or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 206,242
      (+633) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 95 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts that have not submitted any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has
      decreased continuously; on 12th July, 125 districts reported no cases during the past 7 days.

      Germany by county and federal state (27/07/20220, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
      information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 63,507 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (28/07/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all reported cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 5,878 were children under 10 years of age (2.9%), 10,631 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.2%), 91,660 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 61,325 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (30%), 30,819 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,429 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.6%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 500 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48
  years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  The presentation of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 4 shows a continuous, distinct decrease in the relative proportion of
  people over 80 years of age from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a marked
  decrease in the number of cases, which also continued in the following weeks. In comparison, the
  proportion of cases in the younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same
  period, with a corresponding decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportion
  across all age groups entered a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations. The absolute number of
  cases increased in the last two weeks.

  weeks 10 to 29 (21/07/2020, 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cases is depicted by the red line.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 175,468 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
  cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,226 cases (3.0%). Since
  calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
  ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
  reported in 4,713 of 31,579 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,442 (17%) of 179,662 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status. Table 2 depicts the proportion of hospitalization and deaths according to
  notification week.
  Approximately 190,800 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

  In total, 9,122 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.4% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,044 (55%) are men and 4,073 (45%) are women (see Table 3), the gender was unknown in
  five cases. The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,800 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
  older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
  under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
  all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
  the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
  female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
  among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
  reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
  persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Countries of Exposure
  Borders have begun to open since reporting week 25, initially within Europe. Since then, among the
  countries reported as the probable place of exposure, the proportion of countries other than Germany

  has increased. This proportion peaked at 46% (2,969 cases) in reporting week 11, after which it rapidly
  decreased in association with the implemented travel restrictions to 0.4% (19 cases) in week 20. From
  week 21 onwards, this proportion has again increased to 11% (419 cases) in week 30.

  Despite the increase in the number of cases reported having a place of exposure abroad, the majority of
  recent cases acquired their infection in Germany. Through consistent prevention and early
  identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be prevented. To this end, it remains essential
  that people follow the hygine and distancing recommendations, avoid crowds and that all persons who
  develop COVID-19 compatible symptoms obtain testing immediately.
  Outbreaks
  Three districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: The districts
  of Hof and Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria and the district of Weimar in Thuringia.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to an outbreak among harvest workers of an agricultural
  company. Among over 450 employees, 174 SARS-CoV-2-infections were identified. Quarantine was
  ordered for the entire operation. The local population (3300 inhabitants) has been offered voluntary
  testing.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
  Hof (Bavaria). Several events are responsible for this increase. An outbreak in a large family has
  extended to several families in surrounding towns. Another outbreak is related to an event including
  persons from Hof as well as Weimar in Thuringia. Together with another family-related outbreak, this
  explains the currently increased incidence of >25 cases in 7-days/100.000 inhabitants there. Due to
  ongoing screening, further cases can be expected.
  Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.

    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 5: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 28/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 24/07/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.25 (95%-prediction interval: 1.01 – 1.49) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 28/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.12 (95% prediction
    interval: 0.99 – 1.26) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 28/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    The reported 7-day R value has been at 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a larger
    number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased steadily in
    recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

   DIVI intensive care register
       A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
       RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
       number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
       hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       As of 28/07/2020, a total of 1,273 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
       33,007 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,439 (65%) are occupied, and 11,568 beds (35%)
       are currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in
       Table 6.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases declined from mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers
       have been steadily increasing. Currently, a number of districts are transmitting very few or no cases to
       the RKI. However, reports of outbreaks in various settings are again increasing. The RKI currently
       assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups.
       This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.

     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
     capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
     burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
