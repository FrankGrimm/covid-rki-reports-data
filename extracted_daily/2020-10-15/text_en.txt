COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 15/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore,
     the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 34.1 cases per 100,000 population.
 • In comparison, the 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in Hesse, North Rhine-
     Westphalia and Saarland moderately higher and in Baden-Wuerttemberg slightly higher than the national
     mean 7-day incidence.
 • The districts Berlin – Neukoelln, Bitburg-Pruem, Sankt Wendel and Berlin – Mitte exceeded a 7-day incidence
     of 100 cases/100,000 population. The 7-day incidence was 50 to 100 cases/100,000 population in 56 districts,
     in 125 additional districts it exceeded 25 cases/100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again.
 • A number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are being
     reported particularly in the context of family events, and in nursing homes.
 • In total, 341,223 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,710 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
     electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
 • The RKI has published recommendations on test criteria and prevention measures at schools during the
     COVID-19 pandemic.
 • The National Testing Strategy was updated and includes targeted antigen testing and extension of testing to
     further population groups.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 15/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in nearly all federal states. The proportion of
      COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently considerably increasing, while the proportion of
      cases among travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. Since the end of September, an
      increase of the R-values, which are above one, can be observed.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      nursing homes.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. As elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-
      CoV-2, hospitalisations and deaths are increasing. Severe cases and deaths can mainly be prevented
      through decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.
      The National Testing Strategy was updated on the basis of an ordinance on testing for SARS-CoV-2 which
      will enter into force on 15 October 2020. The overall objective of the National Testing Strategy remains
      the care for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the protection of vulnerable groups and the prevention of the
      spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The update includes the targeted use of antigen testing and the
      extension of testing to more population groups.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 135,457 cases (40%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (15/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 30% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 185 districts,
  including 2 city districts in Berlin (Neukoelln, Mitte), the district of Sankt Wendel (Saarland) and the
  district of Bitburg-Pruem (Rhineland-Westfalia) with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population
  and 56 additional districts with a 7-day incidences of >50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de ) shows all affected districts.
  Currently, in most districts it is mostly a diffuse situation with increased frequency of COVID-10 cases in
  connection with private celebrations with family and friends. In several affected districts larger
  outbreaks are the cause of the sharp increase in case numbers. However, many smaller outbreaks in
  nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, schools and
  kindergarten, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events, continue to
  contribute to the increase in incidence.
  The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin is due to more diffuse transmission. Stricter distancing
  rules and opening restrictions for restaurants, bars and shops are applied since 10/10/2020.
  In the district of Bitburg-Pruem, too, private birthday parties have contributed significantly to the spread
  of the infections.
  Among the 56 other districts with more than 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants, the increase in incidence in
  the following districts can be attributed mainly to a single outbreak:
  In the district of Cloppenburg 169 cases are related to an outbreak among workers of a slaughterhouse.
  In the district of Esslingen, a cargo centre has developed as a hotspot for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
  addition to a diffuse situation of infection.
  In the city Hamm, more than 200 corona infections are associated with a wedding.

    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
    extracted from the notification system.
                                        4-day R-value                                                         7-day R-value
                                             1.08                                                                  1.22
                             (95%-prediction interval: 0.89 – 1.31)                                (95%-prediction interval: 1.11 – 1.35)
    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
    less affected because every day of the week is used to determine the value.
                                                                          Cases:                  Symptom onset reported

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 15/10/2020, a total of 1,282 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,233
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,514 (71%) are occupied, and 8,719 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
     Table 3: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (15/10/2020, 12:15 PM).

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
      systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 41, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
     relatively stable. Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 41, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
     increased. The number of patient visits due to ARI decreased in children aged 5 to 14 years, but
     increased in all other age groups. Overall, it remained at a similar level to that of previous seasons at this
     time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, virus was detected in 28 of 49 sentinel samples
     (57%) in week 41, 2020, including 25 samples with rhinovirus. SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in three of
     47 analyzed samples. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/ .
     A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 40, 2020, the total number of SARI cases slightly decreased
     compared to week 39. Of all reported SARI cases in week 40, 2020, 7% were diagnosed with COVID-19
     (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (See Figure 3). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10
     Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this
     analysis.

  Data on emergency department utilisation
     Data on emergency department utilisation
     In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
     the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
     https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
     As of 11 October 2020, data from 8 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between 1
     November 2019 and 1 March 2020, an average of 5,691 emergency department admissions per week
     was recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 42% decrease in the number of admissions
     was observed, to 3,307 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable
     surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions,
     public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase in
     admissions has been observed. In week 41 2020, 5,042 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the
     number of admissions is currently 11% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see
     Figure 4).
