  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1). Age-specific case numbers and age-

  Figure 2 displays the total number of cases with or without COVID-19 relevant symptoms as well as

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
     clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
     ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey,
     via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance
     established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a
     professional association of laboratory medicine.
     The number of tests, the proportion of positive tests as well as the number of reporting laboratories since
     the beginning of testing in Germany are shown in table 2. Since laboratories can register and correct the
     tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can change
     retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of persons
     tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients (Table 2) with data for the last weeks –
     complete data since beginning of testing are available at (in German). The current testing criteria can be
     found under: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In week 12, 2021, the ARI rate decreased in total. The ARI rate
     increased in the age group 0 to 4 years, and decreased or remained stable in all other age groups. Since
     week 36, 2020, the total ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years. Further information can be
     found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network on primary care level. In week
     12, 2021, the overall number of patient visits (consultations) due to ARI (ARI consultation rate) slightly
     increased. The ARI consultation rate increased in ages 15 to 59 years, but remained stable in the other age
     groups. The ARI consultation rate remained on a substantially lower level compared to previous years.
     Within the virological surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 149 of 276 sentinel
     samples (54%) in week 12, 2021. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 98 (36%), human seasonal
     coronavirus (hCoV) in 42 (15%), SARS-CoV-2 in 12 (4%) and Parainfluenzavirus was found in three samples
     (1%). Further information - both on national and regional level - can be found under
     https://influenza.rki.de/ and under https://influenza.rki.de/Diagrams.aspx?agiRegion=0.
     A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
     (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
     respiratory tract). The number of SARI cases increased further in week 11, 2021 in all age groups. After a
     continuous decrease since the turn of the year in the age group 80 years and above, the number of SARI
     cases increased substantially again in week 11, 2021. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI
     has fluctuated around 50% in the last few weeks. In week 11, 2021, 53% of the reported SARI cases per
     week were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). Please note that due to data
     availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of
     up to one week were included in this analysis.

    Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
       population to be very high. The revised version highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-
       CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of many outbreaks especially in households, day-care facilities for children
       and increasingly in schools as well as and occupational settings.
       Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
       rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
       outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
       vulnerable persons.
       On 15/03/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
       current version can be found here: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).
    Measures taken in Germany

8    COVID-19 Situation Report 01/04/2021
  Annex
     1
       The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
       transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
     2
       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
       number of recovered cases.
     3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
       hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
