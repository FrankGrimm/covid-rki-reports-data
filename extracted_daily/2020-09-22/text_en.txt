 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. Since 14/09/2020 the
 RKI situation report will be published in a shortened version. The report will be more focused on the current situation. Demographic and clinical
 aspects, for which there are only few daily changes, will be presented once a week and in a weekly comparison. Further data is also available in
 the COVID 19 dashboard: https://corona.rki.de

  Summary (as of 22/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
  •     After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
        COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must
        still be carefully monitored.
  •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 13.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
        The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 3 districts: the cities of Hamm and
        Würzburg and the district Cloppenburg. A total of 6 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7
        days.
  •     The 7-day incidence in Bavaria and Berlin is considerably and in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hamburg
        and North Rhine-Westphalia noticeably higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  •     In total, 274,158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,396 deaths associated with COVID-19
        have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
  •     A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
        clusters occur particularly in nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and
        refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family
        events and among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 22/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
    confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
    cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as
    cases of COVID-19 disease.
    General current assessment
    After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, further increase is currently observed in
    the population of Germany. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly
    increasing, while the proportion of cases among travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The
    R-value is currently around 1.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different situations,
    including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends or, especially in cases among younger people,
    outbreaks originating from travel returnees.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The number of deaths among reported
    COVID-19 cases is currently low. This is mainly due to the relatively high proportion of younger people
    among newly diagnosed cases in the last weeks, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. If the trend
    continues and more elderly and vulnerable people get infected, an increase in hospitalisations and deaths is
    to be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 274,158
  (+1,821) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
  RKI (Table 1). A total of 6 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a total of
  139 districts reported zero cases.

     Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
     transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
     Distribution of cases over time
     The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
     transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
     of symptoms is unknown for 100,710 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

   The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
   group and reporting week in Figure 2 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
   the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
   proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
   from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
   cases.

  This development continued in the following weeks. By comparison, the proportion of cases in the
  younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
  decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
  a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations. However, as of week 32 the proportion of cases among 10
  to 29 year olds increased. Absolute case numbers increased from week 29 to 34, stabilizing until week
  36. Since reporting week 37, however, case numbers have increased again, concurrent with a slight
  increase in the proportion of cases among older age groups.
  Figure 3: Presentation of the notified COVID-19 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants in Germany by age group and reporting week
  (22/09/2020, 12 AM)
  Figure 4 shows that at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, COVID-19 incidence increased initially
  among 15-34 year olds and 35-59 year olds, followed by older persons over 80 years of age. After the
  decline in incidence for all age groups, the highest incidence since the renewed increase in case numbers
  is currently seen in the age group of 15 to 34-year-olds, followed by the age group of 5 to 14-year-olds
  and now also the 35-59-year-olds. Since reporting week 37, an increase in incidence can be seen among
  persons 60 years of age and older.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 224,320 (82%) of the notified cases. Among these, cough
  (44%), fever (36%), rhinorrhoea (21%) and sore throat (20%) were reported most and 14% had no or no
  relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Pneumonia was reported in 5,670 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17,
  cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and
  anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in 12,823
  of 79,771 cases (16%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 33,771 (14%) of 233,670 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 243,700 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

   * Data not yet meaningful, as outcome of the diseases in these weeks is still unclear
   Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. After a peak in the
   proportion of deaths among all notified cases at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020, this proportion
   decreased markedly in subsequent weeks, to under 1% in the past few weeks. There are primarily two
   reasons for this development:
   Firstly, the mean age of cases has decreased markedly since the first wave in April. On average, younger
  persons have a lower risk of severe disease progression or death following SARS-CoV-2 infection than
  older persons.
  Secondly, test capacity was increased markedly. Increasingly, testing is available not only for persons
  with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or those with exposure to the virus through contact to a COVID-

  19 case. This has led to the identification of more infected and symptomatic cases. More testing among
  older age groups has also led to increased detection of cases. The proportion of deaths among
  hospitalized cases as well as cases requiring intensive care has remained relatively stable.
  There is no indication that this development can be explained through a change in the virus, such as
  decreased transmissibility or virulence. Therapeutic options in severe cases continue to be limited. If
  SARS-CoV-2 transmission increases among older persons, more severe cases and deaths can be
  expected. Therefore, limiting spread of this virus in the population remains the only possibility of
  preventing cases with severe disease progression and deaths.

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to day of death are shown by calendar week in Figure 4.
  Of all deaths, 8,011 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 14% of all cases were in this
  age group (Table 3). Thus far, two deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for both of them. The number of
  deaths may change after data validation is completed.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

   *for care according to § 33 IfSG only cases under 18 years of age are taken into account, as other information may be assumed to be incorrect.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 4).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Possible countries of exposure
   Of the 274,158 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
   88,975 (32%) cases.
   In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
   place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of
   reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting a
   probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and has declined
   again since, to currently 12% (Figure 4). In weeks 35-38, 10,422 persons reported a possible site of
   infection abroad, naming individual countries 10,390 times (more than one country specified in some
   cases).

    avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
    immediately. In addition, travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
    maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
    https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
    Outbreaks
   In 36 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
   the district Cloppenburg and the cities of Hamm and Würzburg, with 7-day incidences of > 50
   cases/100,000 population.
   The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to over 80 cases in connection with a
   wedding. Over 200 identified guests are quarantined and required to be tested. Stricter distancing
   measures have been implemented in Hamm.
   The increased incidence in the district of Cloppenburg can be attributed to several COVID-19 clusters
   after outbreaks in sport clubs, families, nurseries, und religious communities. Responsible authorities
   implemented extensive regional measures, e.g. (partly) closings of schools and sport clubs, restaurants
   and event locations. Furthermore, serial testing of affected facilities was performed.
   The increased incidence in the city of Würzburg can be attributed to COVID-19 cluster after an outbreak
   in a shisha bar and further cases in private (bar visit) or work environments. Stricter restrictions for social
   gatherings were implemented. The increased incidence in the surrounding rural district of Würzburg is
   also related to this outbreak.
   In the city of Munich several outbreaks in various settings have contributed to the increased 7-day
   incidence, which fell just under 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants today. Current measures comprise a ban on
   the selling and consuming of alcohol, continued requirement to wear a mouth and nose mask in schools,
   a ban on spectators at football games and intensified control measures during public celebrations.
   The increased incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to transmission during family and other
   private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing.
   The number of COVID-19-related outbreaks reported in nursing homes; hospitals, facilities for asylum
   seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious
   events has increased.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 6) and not directly
    extracted from the notification system.
                           4-day R-value                                     7-day R-value
                                 0.92                                             0.99
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.73 - 1.12)                  (95%-prediction interval: 0.89 – 1.10)

    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 22/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 18/09/2020).
    The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are below or
    around 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers,
    particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number of
    smaller outbreaks.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
    collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
    well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
    16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
    (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
    As of 22/09/2020, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,621
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,765 (71%) are occupied, and 8,856 (28%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

       reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
       in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
       dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
       worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
       beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased markedly. Many of these cases were
       associated with travellers. Since calendar week 35 transmissions within Germany can be observed to a
       larger extent. Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in
       connection with celebrations with family and friends and at group events. There are still no approved
       vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
       The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
       very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
       play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
       indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m is
       maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained,
       e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of
       transmission outdoors.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
       individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
       previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
       Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
       main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
       (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
       rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
