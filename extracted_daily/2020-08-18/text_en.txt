COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

        Summary (as of 18/08/2020 12:00 AM)
            In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly in many federal states and the
             number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased
             considerably. This trend is very concerning.
            The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 8.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus remains at an increased level. A total of only 18 districts transmitted zero cases over the
             past 7 days. In a further 172 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
            In North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Hesse the 7-day incidences are markedly, in Bavaria slightly
             above the national mean 7-day-incidence.
            In total, 225,404 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,236 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
            Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, meat-processing plants,
             agricultural and other occupational settings, educational settings and especially among travellers
             and in the context of religious events or events with family and friends.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 18/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. It is noticeable that the average age of infection has decreased over the past few
      weeks, the incidence in younger age groups has increased and is higher than in older age groups.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many smaller outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in
      various settings, such as larger family events. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases are
      being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups. The variety
      and number of transmission settings has led to a substantial increase in the number of cases.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is increasing in dynamic and is very concerning. A further worsening of the situation must be avoided.
      On one hand, the increase in younger age groups needs to be stopped, on the other hand, transmission
      into older and vulnerable groups needs to be prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises
      among elderly people, hospitalisations and deaths will likely rise as well. This will only succeed if the
      entire population continues to be committed to decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing
      rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also in outdoor settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where
      indicated, wearing a community or face mask correctly as well as by avoiding mass gatherings –
      especially in indoor areas – and limiting close contacts to immediate family and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 225,404
      (+1,390) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 18 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past
      few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
      decreased continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.

      Germany by county and federal state (18/08/2020, 00:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
      information on number of COVID-19 cases by district (local health authority).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 74,218 cases (33%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (18/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 7,419 were children under 10 years of age (3.3%), 13,464 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6,0%), 102,386 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 64,362 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (29%), 31,645 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,528 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.5%). The age and/or gender was unknown in 600 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 47
  years (median age 47 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  The presentation of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 4 shows a continuous, distinct decrease in the relative proportion of
  people over 80 years of age from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a marked
  decrease in the number of cases, which also continued in the following weeks. In comparison, the

  proportion of cases in the younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same
  period, with a corresponding decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportion
  across all age groups entered a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations, while as of week 32 the
  proportion of the 10 to 30 year olds is increasing. The absolute number of cases has been increasing
  since week 28.

  weeks 10 to 33 (18/08/2020, 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cases is depicted by the red line.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 189,072 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (46%), fever (39%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,368 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 6,716 of 44,776 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 31,638 (16%) of 195,368 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 203,000 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

  A total of 9,236 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.1% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,117 (55%) are men and 4,115 (45%) are women (see Table 3), the gender is unknown in four
  cases.
  The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,894 (85%) were
  in people aged 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Thus far, three deaths
  among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical
  conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in
  meat processing plants.
  Possible countries of exposure
  Of the 225,404 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
  73.958 (33%) cases.

  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% (2,976 cases) for cases that had a possible
  foreign country as place of exposure and thereby the highest so far. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in
  reporting week 20 (19 cases) as a result of travel restrictions. Since the 25th reporting week, the first
  border openings have taken place, initially in Europe. Since then, the proportion of cases reporting a
  probable country of infection abroad has been rising again. In reporting week 33 it was 39% (2,952
  cases).
  Table 5 lists the top 15 countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks
  30 to 33. The Western Balkan countries, as well as Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania and Poland were
  most frequently reported as the country of exposure. When looking at the different age groups (not
  shown), it is noticeable that among the cases with information on Kosovo and Turkey, children and
  middle-aged persons are more likely to be affected, which indicates possible travel within the family
  group. On the other hand, in the cases with probable country of infection Spain and Croatia, persons
  between 20-24 years of age are more likely to be affected, which in turn points more to pleasure
  tourism.

  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad has increased significantly in recent
  weeks. Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases
  can be greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and
  hygiene and avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be
  tested immediately. In addition, travelers who have been in a risk area within 14 days of entry must
  maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).

  Outbreaks
  Nine districts reported an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts of
  Dingolfing-Landau and Altoetting in Bavaria, the cities of Herne, Hagen, Duisburg, Bochum and
  Wuppertal in Northrhine Westphalia, the district of Berlin Mitte and the city of Offenbach in Hesse.
  In the district of Dingolfing-Landau the incidence increased due to two outbreaks, the first in an
  agricultural company and the second – responsible for most of the currently active cases - in a canning
  company, with together close to 500 COVID-19-cases. The renewed increase to >100 Covid-19
  cases/100,000 inhabitants is due to further cases detected through retesting of exposed persons as well
  as new cases in the general population, including among returning travellers. No spread from the
  outbreaks to the general population has been detected thus far.
  In the district of Altoetting the increased incidence is most probably related to returning travellers.
  In the cities of Herne, Hagen, Duisburg, Wuppertal, Berlin Mitte, Hagen, Bochum and Offenbach cases
  detected among travellers entering Germany as well as family clusters play an important role in the
  observed high 7-day incidence.
  Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  educational settings, meat-processing plants and other occupational settings, in the context of family
  events and religious communities as well as among travellers.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.

  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

      A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
      estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
      This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
      outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
      affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
      relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.06 (95%-prediction interval: 0.88 – 1.28) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 18/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.05 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.94 – 1.18) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 18/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
      The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. According to current
      observation, this seems to be associated to a great extent with an increasing number of cases among
      travel returnees. Further it is also associated with a larger number of smaller outbreaks and case
      numbers in Germany overall, which have increased steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the
      measures.

   DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 18/08/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
      30,565 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,701 (71%) are occupied, and 8,864 (28%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

       increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with even an
       acceration in recent weeks. At the same time, the number of districts that have not reported any cases
       in the last 7 days is decreasing. There are larger and smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in
       connection with celebrations in the circle of family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees,
       especially in the younger age groups, also contribute to the increase in the number of cases.Vaccines
       and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of
       the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
       play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
       indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
       is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
       maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
       risk of transmission outdoors.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
       individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
       previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
       Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
       care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
       large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
       system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
