        COVID-19 Situation Report 15/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory confirmed
    cases of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of clinical symptoms and disease severity. Thus, in the following report the
    term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July has now stabilized at a slightly higher level. The
    R-value is currently around 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks more young people have become
    infected, thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different situations,
    including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends or, especially in cases among younger people,
    outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The proportion of COVID-19 cases among travel returnees has
    been decreasing since calendar week 34, while the absolute number of cases remains constant. This shows
    that people are increasingly being infected again within Germany.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the proportion of
    deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of younger people
    among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A renewed increase in
    new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a renewed increase
    among the elderly and vulnerable groups of the population, as was the case at the beginning of the
    pandemic. If more elderly and vulnerable people become infected again, a renewed increase in
    hospitalizations and deaths must be expected. Since last week there has been a slight increase in the
    number of cases in the higher age groups; this trend should be observed carefully.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 15/09/2020

   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (15/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Demographic distribution of cases
   Figure 2: Percent of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=260,775 cases with respective data in the
   weeks 10 to 37 (15/09/2020, 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cases is depicted by the red line.
   The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
   group and reporting week in Figure 2 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
   the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
   proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
   from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
   cases.

This development continued in the following weeks. In comparison, the proportion of cases in the
younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations, but as of week 32 the proportion of cases among 10 to 29
year olds has increased. After the absolute number of cases has been increasing since week 29, they
have stabilized since week 34. Since reporting week 37, the proportion of older age groups is increasing
again.
Figure 3: Presentation of the notfied COVID-19 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants in Germany by age group and reporting week
(15.09.2020, 12 AM)
The illustration in Figure 4 shows that at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, the age groups of
15-34 year olds and 35-59 year olds were the first to show increased incidence, followed by the group
over 80 years of age. After the decline in incidence for all age groups, the highest incidence since the
renewed increase in case numbers is currently seen in the age group of 15 to 34-year-olds, followed by
the age group of 5 to 14-year-olds and now also the 35-59-year-olds. A beginning increase in incidence in
the over-80 age group can be observed..
Clinical aspects
Information on symptoms is available for 215,613 (82%) of the notified cases. Among these, cough
(44%), fever (37%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%) were reported most and 13% had no or no
relevant COVID-19 symptoms, respectively. Pneumonia was reported in 5,579 cases (3%). Since calendar
week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia
and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in
11,294 of 71,101 cases (16%).
Hospitalisation was reported for 33,301 (15%) of 225,110 COVID-19 cases with information on
hospitalisation status.
Approximately 234,600 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number. Table 2 shows
the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The highest mean age of COVID-19
cases as well as the highest proportions of hospitalized patients and deaths were reported in weeks
16/17 and have been decreasing since. From week 29 to 34, the weekly number of total cases has been
increasing. Since then, the number of cases has stabilized at a slightly higher level and an increase in the
average age can be observed again.
