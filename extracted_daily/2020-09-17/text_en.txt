COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. Since 14/09/2020 the
RKI situation report will be published in a shortened version. The report will be more focused on the current situation. Demographic and clinical
aspects, for which there are only few daily changes, will be presented once a week and in a weekly comparison. Further data is also available in
the COVID 19 dashboard: https://corona.rki.de
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 17/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
 •     After a high increase between calendar week 29 and 34, the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence had stabilized
       in calendar weeks 35 and 36, but since calendar week 37, a slight increase can be observed. Therefore,
       the situation must still be carefully monitored.
 •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 11.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The
       7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 4 districts: the city of Würzburg, the
       districts of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Kulmbach and the city of Kaufbeuren . A total of 10 districts
       transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
 •     In Bavaria the 7-day incidence is considerably higher, in Berlin, Hamburg, Baden-Wuerttemberg and
       North Rhine-Westphalia noticeably higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
 •     In total, 265,857 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,371 deaths associated with COVID-19
       have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
 •     Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing homes
       and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
       settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 17/09/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory confirmations
    of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
    following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19
    disease.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July had stabilized at a slightly higher level in calendar
    weeks 35 and 36, but since calendar week 37, a slight increase can be observed again. The R-value is currently
    around 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks more young people have become infected, thus the 7-day
    incidence is significantly higher in younger age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different situations,
    including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends or, especially in cases among younger people,
    outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The proportion of COVID-19 cases among travel returnees has
    been decreasing since calendar week 34, while the absolute number of cases remains constant. This shows
    that people are increasingly being infected again within Germany.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the proportion of deaths
    among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of younger people among the
    newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A renewed increase in new infections
    must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a renewed increase among the elderly
    and vulnerable groups of the population, as was the case at the beginning of the pandemic. If more elderly and
    vulnerable people become infected again, a renewed increase in hospitalizations and deaths must be
    expected. Since last week there has been a slight increase in the number of cases in the higher age groups; this
    trend should be observed carefully.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by consistently
    observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and, where necessary,
    by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided if possible
    and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 265,857 (+2,194)
  laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the RKI (Table
  1). A total of 10 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days, while on 16/06/2020 the number of districts
  reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

      Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
      transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
      Distribution of cases over time
      The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
      transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
      symptoms is unknown for 96,364 cases (36%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

   alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (17/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
   COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in
  25% of cases, the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here
   should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned
  facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 2). The
  number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The high
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.

  Outbreaks
  In 28 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including the
  urban district of Würzburg, the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the district of Kulmbach and the urban
  district of Kaufbeuren where the incidence is > 50 cases/100,000 population. Most districts affected are in
  the federal state of Bavaria.
  In Kulmbach, the increased incidence is due to private festivities attended by students from several schools.
  This led to the closure of five school classes and restrictions on meetings in public and private spaces.
  The increased incidence in the city of Würzburg can be attributed to COVID-19 cluster after an outbreak in a
  shisha bar and further cases in private (bar visit) or work environments. On 10.09.2020, a general ruling was
  published for the city which provides for restrictions on private events (max. 50 persons indoors, max. 100
  persons outdoors) and on the serving of alcohol on the Old Main Bridge (city center).
  A travel returnee contributed to the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen
  district. She had stayed in several locations despite symptoms and ordered quarantine.
  The increased incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to transmission during family and other
  private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing.
  An increase in COVID-19-related outbreaks is reported in nursing homes; hospitals, facilities for asylum
  seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious
  events are continuously reported.

       Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
       The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. R
       can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly extracted
       from the notification system.

       reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 17/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 13/09/2020).
       The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are below or around
       1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers, particularly
       returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number of smaller
       outbreaks.
       Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
       https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
       with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
       number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
       with intensive care beds are required to report. (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)

     As of 17/09/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,785
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,304 (72%) are occupied, and 8,481 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in
     the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In week 37, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased slightly.
     Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 37, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
     increased. The ARI incidence increased in all age groups. Overall, it remained at a similar level to that of
     previous seasons at this time of the year, but was elevated in the age group 5 to 14 years. Within the viral
     surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 28 of 37 sentinel samples (76%) in week 37, 2020. Since
     week 16, 2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected within the viral sentinel surveillance of the AGI. Further
     information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
     (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
     respiratory tract). In week 36, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable compared to week 35,
     but increased in the age group 5 to 14 years. Of all reported SARI cases in week 36, 2020, 3% were
     diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 3). Please note that due to data availability only
     patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week
     were included in this analysis.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Data on emergency department utilisation
      In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/), the
      RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
      https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
      As of 13 September 2020, data from 9 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between 1
      November 2019 and 1 March 2020, an average of 6,356 emergency department admissions per week was
      recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was
      observed, to 3,697 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable surveillance
      systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions, public measures were
      taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase in admissions has been
      observed. In week 37 2020, 5,860 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the number of admissions is
      currently 8% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see Figure 5).

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     General assessment
     At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a dynamic
     and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase worldwide.
     The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the beginning of July,
     since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week. Large and small
     outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with celebrations with family
     and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups, have also
     contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no approved vaccines and the
     treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
     The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
     very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on the
     regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene measures
     and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact) play a special
     role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In indoor rooms, this
     significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m is maintained. If the
     minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained, e.g. when groups of
     people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of transmission outdoors.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
      individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known previous
      illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening. Long-term
     consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the main
      population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation,
      quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase
      locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
