  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since 27/01/2020, a total of 79,696 (+6,174) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 1,017 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and

    Germany by county and federal state (03/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for information on number of COVID-19-cases by county (local
    health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19-cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 31,759 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 51% are male and 49% are female. Among notified cases, there are 602 children
    under 5 years of age, 1,560 children aged 5 to 14 years, 57,228 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 15,036
    aged 60 to 79 years and 5,090 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 180 notified
    cases is unknown. The median age of cases is 49 years.

    with information available (03/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 58,209 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms
    are cough (53%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (23%). Pneumonia was reported in 1,250 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 8,055 (14%) of 58,779 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    An estimated 23,800 persons are estimated to have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases
    were considered to have recovered if they had a known symptom onset on or before 20/03/2020,
    were not reported to have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been
    discharged and did not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of
    symptom onset, symptoms, hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
    The 1,017 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 661 (65%) men
    and 354 (35%) women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 105 years. Of all deaths, 871
    (86%) were in persons 70 years or older, but only 13% of all cases were 70 years or older. Reports on
    COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the number
    of deaths is relatively high.

      DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was set up to document the capacities for intensive
      care as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals:
      https://www.divi.de/register/intensivregister.
      As of 03/04/2020, 1,052 hospitals or departments are participating (+77 since yesterday). A total of
      22,196 intensive care beds were registered, of which 12,499 (56%) are occupied and 9,697 beds are
      currently available; 9,178 beds are expected to become available within 24 hours (Table 3).

      Laboratory tests
      In addition to the available aggregated weekly data on SARS-CoV-2 testing in Germany (see Situation
      Report 02.04.2020), the national Network for the Surveillance of Antibiotic resistance (ARS) is
      collecting more detailed data on SARS-CoV-2 tests being performed by participating laboratories on a
      daily basis. Thus far, the currently 48 participating laboratories performed 283,992 tests, of which
      22,896 (8,1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 02.04.2020). More details can be found here:

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe
      and fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population
      overall as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression
      increases with increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region.
      The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases,
      health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing
      etc.), and may be very high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice
      as a result of new findings.

   Other measures
     -     Field teams of the RKI are currently supporting outbreak containment measures with a focus on
           outbreaks in retirement and health care homes as well as hospitals in several federal states.
     -     Since 31/03/2020, the RKI no longer specifies particularly affected areas in Germany. Outbreaks
           are ongoing in many districts, some with high case numbers. Data on current disease activity in the
           districts can be found on the dashboard https://corona.rki.de/ and in the daily situation reports.
     -     A new federal law was implemented on 28/03/2020 for the protection of the public in the event of
           epidemic situations, granting the federal government additional competencies for the control of
           epidemics. https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2020/1-
           quartal/corona-gesetzespaket-im-bundesrat.html
     -     As of 23/03/2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and
           household members) are banned in all federal states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with
           body care were closed. In public spaces, all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to
