  The difference to previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay of data transmission former cases may be included.

  Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3
  The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 17/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
        strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 141 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 104 cases/100,000 population.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, Saxony and Rhineland-Palatinate
        is higher than the national total 7-day incidence.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 6 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000 population. In
        comparison, 274 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 20 districts have an incidence
        of >250 cases/100,000 population.
    • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households, but also in
        community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to religious
        events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • Since mid of October, the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has strongly increased, from 655 patients
        on October 15th to 3,517 patients on 17/11/2020.
    • On 17/11/2020, 14,419 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 267 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
        been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 17/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating and is
      currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still
      a high number of new cases every day.
      The data table on page 1 was adapted on November 11. The aim of the change is to focus on the current
      situation primarily. Therefore, changes to the previous day are given priority. Reporting data from other
      surveillance systems will become more visible. In particular data on ICU capacities are of great
      importance in the current situation.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including households and in old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts
      there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 815,746
  (+14,419) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e,g, detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 429,617 cases (53%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (17/11/2020, 12:00 AM).

  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and
  age-specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  The first wave of the pandemic in Germany started in week 11 with a high 7-day incidence in 20-59-year-
  olds followed by a rising incidence in the over-80 years old until week 15, which fell again until week 24,
  Since reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence has increased steadily starting in younger age-
  groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups. Among 20-29-year-olds, a slight decrease is
  seen from reporting week 46 upwards; while among the 30-69-year-olds, case numbers seem to have
  reached a high level plateau.

  * Data not yet meaningful, as outcome of the diseases in these weeks is still unclear
  Table 3 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The proportion of deaths
  among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it decreased markedly until
  week 34 and has remained well under 1% since then. The proportion of cases reported with no or no
  symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until week 34 to 35%, but decreased since then to
  below 20% after week 38.

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to week of death are shown Figure 3. The number of deaths has been
  increasing since week 37; markedly since week 42.
  Of all deaths, 11,037 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 12% of all cases were in this
  age group (Table 4). Thus far, 6 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported
  to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for two of the six cases.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 5). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 17/11/2020

  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 74% were female and 26% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Since week 38 a new software version is available for the collection of data on care, accommodation and
  occupation in respective institutions. Due to fundamental changes in the data format, this data could not
  be included in the reporting so far. In the meantime, RKI has adjusted the analysis strategy so that there
  is a noticeable increase in all categories compared to yesterday.

   reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting a
   probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined
   again since then. While the absolute figures for cases with foreign exposure since week 38 are at an
   average of 1551 cases per week [range 755 - 2064], the proportion has clearly decreased to 0,6% in week
   46. This is due to the high number of autochthonous cases, which is >100,000 cases in the last 7 days. In
   weeks 43-46, 6,553 persons reported a possible site of infection abroad.
   Table 6 lists the countries in addition to Germany that were most frequently reported as the probable
   place of infection in weeks 43 to 46. Poland, Romania, Italy, Turkey, and Austria were most frequently
   reported as the country of exposure.

   The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad increased significantly after the
   opening of borders in calendar week 25, but has been declining again since week 35 (see Figure 4).
   Travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must maintain a 10-day quarantine
   unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (see
   https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium,de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
   Outbreaks
   An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
   (406 of 412). There are 20 districts in the group of the highest incidence of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in
   the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
   In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many small
   outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
   and community facilities, kindergartens and schools, various occupational settings and in the context of
   religious gatherings continue to contribute to the increase of incidence.
   Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
   The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person,
   The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that
   shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for

   the last few days, This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
   given for the R-value, After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
   the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards, In recent weeks, values reported at
   the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards, They had thus slightly underestimated
   the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable,
   The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6,

   Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value, The 7-day R-value is
   less affected because all week days are used to determine the value,

      COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 17/11/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 13/11/2020),
      The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past few days the R-value has
      been fluctuating and is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-
      CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this
      means that there is still a high number of new cases every day.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

   DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
      As of 17/11/2020, a total of 1,288 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,337
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,818 (77%) are occupied, and 6,519 (23%) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 7.

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
