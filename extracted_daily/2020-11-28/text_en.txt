   COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
   Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
   situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

     Summary (as of 28/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
     • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
         strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
     • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Thuringia is higher than the national
         total 7-day incidence of 136 cases per 100,000 population.
     • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
         incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 113 cases/100,000 population.
     • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 8 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000 population. In
         comparison, 267 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 25 districts have an incidence
         of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and one district of >500-1000 cases/100,000 population.
     • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households,
         but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to
         religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
     • Between mid-October and mid-November, the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care increased dramatically,
         from 655 patients on 15/10/2020 to 3,395 on 15/11/2020. Since then, the increase has slowed down slightly, with 3,888
         cases on 28/11/2020.
     • On 28/11/2020, 21,695 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 379 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
         been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 28/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The increase has
      leveled off since the second week of November. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is
      currently increasing. In November, the reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1. This means
      that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of
      infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every
      day.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including households, in schools and occupational settings. Increasingly, outbreaks in old
      people’s and nursing homes are reported. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
      While the 7-day-incidence among younger age groups is decreasing, the incidence among older people is
      further increasing (cf. situation report 24/11/2020). As they more often have a severe course due to
      COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These can be avoided if we prevent
      the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law. Since January 2020, a total of 1,028,089 (+21,695) laboratory-
  confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *On 26th November, no data were transmitted from Bremen; thus, the difference depicted today comprises cases from two
  days.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 549,015 cases (53%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (28/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (403 of 412). There are 25 districts in the incidence group of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and one district
  in the incidence group of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de)
  shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many small
  outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  and community facilities, kindergartens and schools, various occupational settings and in the context of
  religious gatherings continue to contribute to the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person,
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                         4-day R-value                                                             7-day R-value
                                0.94                                                                     0.96
        (95%-prediction interval: 0.75 – 1.12)                                      (95%- prediction interval: 0.86 – 1.05)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (orange) (as of 28/11/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 24/11/2020).
  Figure 3: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 28/11/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 24/11/2020).
  The reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1 in November. This means that, on average, each
  person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently
  very high in Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every day.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 28/11/2020, a total of 1,288 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,449
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,923 (80%) are occupied, and 5,526 (20%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent increase in case numbers with severe disease, which have to be treated in ICUs and
     the increasingly tense situation in the health system the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     situation on 11/11/2020, The current version can be found here:
