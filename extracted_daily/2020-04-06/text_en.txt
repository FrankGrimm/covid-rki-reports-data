  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 95,391 (+3.677) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 1,434 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and

    Germany by county and federal state (06/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health
    authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 38,072 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 50% are respectively male or female. Among notified cases, there are 733 children
    under 5 years of age, 1,891 children aged 5 to 14 years, 66,896 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 18,307 aged
    60 to 79 years and 7,357 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 207 notified cases is
    unknown. The median age of cases is 49 years.

    information available (06/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 70,291 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are
    cough (52%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 1,580 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 10,050 (14%) of 70,940 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 30,600 persons are estimated to have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases
    were considered to have recovered if they had a known symptom onset before 23/03/2020, were not
    reported to have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged
    and did not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of symptom onset,
    symptoms, hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
    The 1,434 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 913 (64%) men and 518 (36%)
    women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 105 years. Of all deaths, 1,237 (86%) were in
    persons 70 years or older, but only 15% of all cases were in this age group. Reports on COVID-19 related
    outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively
    high.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    International risk areas
      -     The following countries and regions are classified as international risk areas (31/03/2020)
            (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete.html):
                 o Austria
                 o Egypt
                 o France
                 o Iran
                 o Italy
                 o Netherlands
                 o Spain
                 o Switzerland
                 o South Korea: the city of Daegu and the province of Gyeongsangbuk-do (North-Gyeongsang)
                 o United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
                 o United States of America
      The province of Hubei in China is no longer classified as an international risk area (25/03/2020).
    Other measures
      -     RKI teams are currently supporting outbreak containment measures with a focus on outbreaks in
            retirement and health care homes as well as hospitals in several federal states.
      -     Outbreaks are ongoing in many districts, some with high case numbers. Data on current disease
            activity can be found on the dashboard https://corona.rki.de/ and in the daily situation reports.
      -     A new federal law was implemented on 28/03/2020 for the protection of the public in the event of
            epidemic situations, granting the federal government additional competencies for the control of
            epidemics. https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2020/1-
            quartal/corona-gesetzespaket-im-bundesrat.html
      -     As of 23/03/2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and household
            members) are banned in all federal states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with body care
            were closed. In public spaces, all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to other indivduals
