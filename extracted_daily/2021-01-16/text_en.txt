    2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
       data were not recorded regularly.
    4 Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are reported.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

       Summary (as of 16/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
       • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general
           population as very high.
       • Yesterday, 18,678 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 980 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI
           in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 139 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is
           markedly above the national incidence.
       • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 297 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
           32 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and one district has an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.
       • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 107 and of people ≥80 years 289 cases/100,000 population.
       • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,
           occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
       • On 16/01/2021, 5,015 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 396 existing patients had been discharged (37 % of
           whom had died) and 337 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 59 less than the prior day.
       • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,048,160 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (12.6 vaccinated per 1,000 population)
           (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 16/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
  19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to stabilize.
  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this means
  a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is an
  increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
  should be avoided.
  On 19/12/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. To date, it is unknown how the new
  virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been detected in
  numerous countries around the world. So far, a few cases of this new variant in Germany have been
  reported to the RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new virus variant
  detected in South Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility and more severe disease. Isolates
  of this lineage have also been identified sporadically in Germany.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission
  to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case
  numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,019,636
  (+18,678) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  * In Brandenburg. some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases. this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the
  RKI.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases. the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1.100.044 cases (54 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (16/01/2021. 12:00 AM).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 population was reported in all 412 districts. There
  are 32 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100.000 in the last 7 days and there was one district
  with an incidence of >500 cases/100.000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard shows all affected districts
  (https://corona.rki.de).
  In most districts. the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes. occupational settings and private households. In some counties. a specific. larger outbreak is known
  to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated
  incidence. for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number. R. is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2). a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty. which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI. the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and. if necessary. corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks. values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany. values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                                0.99                                                            0.95
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 – 1.12)                            (95%-prediction interval: 0.87 – 1.03)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany. this means
    a high number of new infections per day.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 16/01/2021

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
      with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020. all hospitals
      with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 16/01/2021. a total of 1.281 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall. 26.876
      intensive care beds were registered. of which 22.341 (83 %) are occupied. and 4.535 (17 %) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days. this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers. the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
      as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households. occupational settings and nursing and
      senior care homes.
      Therefore. more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
      is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
      reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021. the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-
      CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:
