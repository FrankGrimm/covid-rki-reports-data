COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data
on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 198,804
    (+248) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been electronically
    reported to and validated by the RKI (see Table 1). Of the 412 districts, 125 reported zero cases in the past
    7 days. Information on laboratory-confirmed cases is also available on the RKI website at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and https://corona.rki.de.

      * No cases were transmitted from Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saxony yesterday. There were technical problems with the
      transmission of data from Hamburg and Saarland, which is why no new cases were transmitted from these federal states either.
      As a result of quality checks and data cleansing by the health authorities and regional offices, corrections to cases already
      transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports) can lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown in 59,911 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

    alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (12/07/20, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Approximately 184,600 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,063 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-
    existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    Outbreaks
    Currently, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including meat-processing plants,
    facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, nursing homes and hospitals as well as in the context of
    families or religious events.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

        Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
        cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
        electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 12/07/20, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 08/07/2020).
        A sensitive R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
        estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
        This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
        outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
        possibly exposed persons, leading to therapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases.
        This can lead to relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the
        case in Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
        The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.04 (95%-prediction interval: 0.81 – 1.26) and is based on
        electronically notified cases as of 12/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
        Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
        compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
        of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.91 (95% prediction
        interval: 0.81 – 1.01) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 12/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
        Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
        under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
        R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
        also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

    Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are

     transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
     German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
     short notice based on new insights.
     Infection risk
     The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
     behaviour.
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
     capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
     burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
