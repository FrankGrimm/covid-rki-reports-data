COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 20/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed.
     Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and
     control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 48.6 cases per 100,000 population.
  • In comparison, the 7-day incidence in Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland
     considerably and in Bavaria slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • The number of districts with an increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants
     continues to rise, to 282 urban and rural districts, in total. Of these, 25 districts have an incidence of
     > 100 cases/100,000 population and 104 districts have an incidence of > 50-100 cases/100,000
     population.
  • Since the beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing
     again.
  • A number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters
     are being reported particularly in the context of family events, and in nursing homes.
  • In total, 373,167 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,836 deaths associated with COVID-19
     have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 20/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently a fast increase in nearly all federal states. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in the
      older age groups is increasing. Since the start of October, R-values have been above 1.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      nursing homes. Additionally, in many districts a mostly diffuse spread of transmissions can be observed
      without distinct chains of infection.
      Since end of July, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below 1% and is
      thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. However, it is regarded as
      implausible that the virus has become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be
      explained as follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people,
      who rarely experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which
      means more milder cases are identified. As elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with
      SARS-CoV-2, hospitalisations and deaths are increasing. Severe cases and deaths can mainly be
      prevented through decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.
      The National Testing Strategy was updated on the basis of an ordinance on testing for SARS-CoV-2 which
      entered into force on 15 October 2020. The overall objective of the National Testing Strategy remains
      the care for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the protection of vulnerable groups and the prevention of the
      spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The update includes the targeted use of antigen testing and the
      extension of testing to more population groups.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 373,167
  (+6,868) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 154,332 cases (41%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
  proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
  from reporting week 17 to reporting week 25, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
  cases. This development continued in the following weeks. By comparison, the proportion of cases in the
  younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
  decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
  a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations. Absolute case numbers increased from week 29. Since
  reporting week 36, however, case numbers have increased again, with considerable increase in the
  proportion of cases among older age groups.
  Figure 3: Presentation of the notified COVID-19 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants in Germany by age group and reporting week
  (20/10/2020, 12 AM)
  Figure 3 shows that at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, COVID-19 incidence increased initially
  among 15-34 year olds and 35-59 year olds, followed by older persons over 80 years of age. After the
  decline in incidence for all age groups, the highest incidence since the renewed increase in case numbers
  is currently seen in the age group of 15 to 34-year-olds, followed by the age group of 5 to 14-year-olds
  and now also the 35-59-year-olds. The incidence increased among persons 60 years of age and older
  from week 36 and from week 40 onwards, an increase can be observed for all age groups. Especially the
  increase in the age groups 60- 79 years and over 80 years must be monitored with great care.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 287,076 (77%) of the notified cases. Among these, cough
  (42%), fever (34%), rhinorrhoea (22%) and sore throat (21%) were reported most and 14% had no or no
  relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Pneumonia was reported in 6,179 cases (2.2%). Since calendar week 17,
  cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and
  anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in 24,321
  of 142,458 cases (17%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 38,287 (13%) of 305,290 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.

  Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The proportion of
  deaths among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it decreased
  markedly until week 34 and has remained well under 1% since then. The proportion of cases reported
  with no or no symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until week 34 to 35%, but decreased
  since then to below 20% after week 38.

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to day of death are shown by calendar week in Figure 4.
  Of all deaths, 8,836 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 13% of all cases were in this
  age group (Table 3). Thus far, five deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI*. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for both of them. The number of
  deaths may change after data validation is completed.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 33% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 4).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various

  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  again since, to currently 3.1% (Figure 5). In weeks 39-42, 5,232 persons reported a possible site of
  infection abroad.
  Table 5 lists the top 16 countries in addition to Germany most frequently reported as the probable place
  of infection in weeks 39 to 42. Turkey, Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Austria and Italy were most
  frequently reported as the country of exposure.

  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad increased significantly after the
  opening of borders in calendar week 25, but has been declining again since week 35 (see Figure 5).
  Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be
  greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and hygiene and
  avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
  immediately. In addition, travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
  maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 282 districts,
  including 25 urban and rural districts with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 104
  districts with a 7-day incidences of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  Only about a quarter of the total number of reported COVID-19 cases can be attributed to a specific
  outbreak. At the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, in weeks 13-18, many COVID-19 cases were
  assigned to nursing homes as well as hospitals and refugee homes, In weeks 23-32, the workplace was
  often given as the probable infection environment. Since the summer (from week 33 on), the number of
  outbreaks in private households has represented the largest share of outbreak situations besides the
  workplace and leisure activities. Recently, the number of cases in old people's homes and nursing homes
  also increased again.

     Overall, the information on the infection environment of outbreaks should be interpreted with caution.
     The assignment to an infection environment is not always clear. Factors contributing to this uncertainty
     are „outbreaks“ with mixed exposure settings in close time intervals, settings which can be less easily
     traced (such as public transport), issues of work force capacities in local health authorities or lack of
     reporting on exposure circumstances.
     Large outbreaks have been detected in the following districts (amongst others):
     In the district of Northeim, an outbreak among employees, residents and guests occurred in a religious
     community. After SARS-CoV-2 was detected in symptomatic individuals, row tests were carried out on
     >250 people. Most of these tests have been evaluated and positive test results are available for 140
     people (as of 19-10-2020). Containment measures have been employed.
     In the LK Traunstein there was a large surge in new infections with currently 234 active cases. The
     starting point seems to have been a party, although different sources of infection and possibly also the
     proximity to the Austrian border must be considered as potential sources. A 14-day curfew was imposed
     for the entire district.
     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 6) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 12/10/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,276
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,301 (71%) are occupied, and 8,872 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
