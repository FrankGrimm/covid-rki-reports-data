    aged 10 to 19 years (4.8%), 84,201 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 58,732 persons aged 50 to 69
    years (31%), 30,060 persons aged 70 to 89 years (16%) and 5,331 persons aged 90 years and older
    (2.8%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 409 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 49 years
    (median age 49 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (26/06/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 164,745 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,001 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,185 of 21,682 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,081 (17%) of 167,393 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 177,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 8,948 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,951 (55%) are men and 3,992 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,671 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,773 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in three districts,
    primarily due to localised outbreaks: The districts of Guetersloh and the neighbouring district of
    Warendorf (both North Rhine-Westphalia) and the district of Goettingen (Lower Saxony).

     COVID-19 Situation Report 26/06/2020

      The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
      plant. The 7-day high incidence in Warendorf and Hamm is linked to the outbreak in Guetersloh.
      Employees of the meat processing company are residents of neighbouring districts. More than 1,500
      employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and
      all employees are being quarantined as well as their household members. In addition, all schools and
      day-care centres in the district of Guetersloh have been closed since 18th of June until the end of the
      summer holidays (11th of August 2020s), in the district of Warendorf since 25th of June. On June 23,
      2020, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia officially activated the second stage of a lockdown for the
      districts of Guetersloh and Warendorf until June 30, 2020. In the affected region, testing for SARS-CoV-2
      is being significantly expanded. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in the food retail sector, kiosk
      staff and residents of central shared accommodation will be tested in Gütersloh and Warendorf. The
      population can have a test performed free of charge. There have also been and still are outbreaks in
      meat processing plants in other federal states, some of which have led to production closures.
      A large COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the district of Goettingen, in the context of highly crowded
      housing conditions. All inhabitants of one large apartment complex have been quarantined until 25th of
      June, control- and support measures are being carried out along with extensive testing. Additionally, an
      outbreak in a refugee facility is reported, affecting more than 20 people.
      Decreasing 7-day incidence is reported from the city of Magdeburg, Saxony (an outbreak that led to
      closing of several schools), in Neukoelln, a district of Berlin, (an outbreak is linked to members of a
      religious community with more than one hundred cases;an entire block of flats has been quarantined)
      and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, another district of Berlin (47 cases in a block of flats so far).
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

7                                                                                                                     7
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.57 (95%-prediction interval: 0.48 – 0.70)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 26/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.02 (95% predictation
      interval: 0.95 – 1.10) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 26/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      The estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) have decreased to a value of 1 or
      below. The strongly increased values in the past few days are related to local accumulations, which are
      described in the section "Outbreaks", with the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly
      important role. The dynamics of the various outbreak events are also influenced in part by serial tests
      carried out in the scope of the detected outbreaks, which can promptly lead to the detection of further
      infected persons. For this reason, the reproduction figures may continue to fluctuate strongly. Since the
      case numbers in Germany are at a low level overall, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong
      influence on the value of the reproduction number.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 26/06/2020, a total of 1,275 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,441
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,220 (65%) are occupied, and 11,221 beds (35%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
       differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
       discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
  Mortality Monitoring
       A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
       excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
       the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
       (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data,
       have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
       monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
       All-cause mortality for the countries in the EuroMOMO network are approaching normal levels,
       following a period of a substantial excess mortality coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. A few
       countries are still seeing some excess mortality. Excess mortality was observed primarily in the age
       group of over-65s, but also in the age group of 15-64s.
       Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with
       a certain time lag (currently 31/05/2020). A special evaluation on excess mortality is updated every two
       weeks: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/Gesellschaft/bevoelkerung-
       sterbefaelle.html (in German). Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there is no
       noticeable increase in the number of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however,
       the mortality figures were significantly above the average of previous years; since the beginning of May,
       the mortality figures have been back to around the average.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.

     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
     capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
     burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
