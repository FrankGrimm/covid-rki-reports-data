    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among notified cases with data on gender,
    4,212 were children under 10 years of age (2.3%), 8,645 children and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years
    (4.6%), 81,112 persons aged 20 to 49 years (43%), 57,729 persons aged 50 to 69 years (31%), 29,733
    persons aged 70 to 89 years (16%) and 5,287 persons aged 90 years and older (2.8%). The age is
    unknown in 90 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 49 years (median age 49 years). The highest
    incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (17/06/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 160,350 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 4,865 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 2,691 of 18,137 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 28,561 (18%) of 161,906 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 173,600 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    In total, 8,830 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.7% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,885 (55%) are men and 3,940 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,576 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 19% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 26% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    So far, 13,542 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 17/06/2020

      Outbreaks
      A high 7-day incidence rate was observed in four districts, primarily due to localised outbreaks: The
      districts of Aichach-Friedberg (Bavaria), Greiz (Thuringia), Guetersloh (North-Rhine-Westphalia) ans
      Verden (Lower Saxony).
      In the district of Aichach-Friedberg the 7-day incidence is slowly decreasing, after an outbreak was
      reported among seasonal harvest workers. Tracing and testing of contacts as well as implementation of
      hygiene and quarantine measures were rapidly implemented. Harvest activities were temporarily
      suspended.
      Once again there were major outbreaks in retirement- and nursing homes. In the districts of Greiz and
      Verden residents and nursing staff have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
      The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to two outbreaks in the meat
      processing sector. Such outbreaks have also occurred in other federal states, some of which have led to
      production closures.
      Further outbreaks were reported among members of religious communities, eg. from Berlin, Hesse and
      Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
      analysis.
                                                                               Cases:                   Symptom onset reported

      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

7                                                                                                                                   7
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day-R-value is 0.86 (95%-prediction interval: 0.73 – 1.02)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 17/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.89 (95%-prediction
      interval: 0.83– 0.96) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 17/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 17/06/2020, a total of 1,274 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 31,711
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,713 (65%) are occupied, and 10,998 beds (35%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
      differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
      discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
      well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
      are transmitted via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses
      (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the
      Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory
      medicine.
      Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 24/2020, 5,029,696 laboratory tests
      have been recorded to date, 220,534 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
      Up to and including week 24, 227 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
      one of the other transmitting networks and communicate mainly on a weekly basis. Since laboratories
      can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the numbers
      determined will increase subsequently. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as
      the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients (see Table 5).

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
