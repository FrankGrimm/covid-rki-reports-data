  The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to the delay of data transmission, cases from previous days may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data are not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 01/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
        encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Thuringia is higher than the national
        total 7-day incidence of 137 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 117 cases/100,000 population.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 10 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000
        population. In comparison, 280 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 23 districts have
        an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and two districts of >500-1000 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
        households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to
        religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • After the strong increase in the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care until mid-November (3,395 cases on
        15/11/2020), the increase has slowed somewhat, with 3,919 cases on 01/12/2020.
    • On 01/12/2020, 13,604 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 388 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
        been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 01/12/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. The increase has leveled off since
      the second week of November. In November, the reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1. This
      means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of
      infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every
      day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly
      in households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and
      educational settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2
      without traceable transmission chains.
      While the 7-day-incidence among younger age groups is stable or slightly decreasing, the incidence
      among older people is further increasing. As the latter more often have more severe illness due to
      COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These can be avoided if we prevent
      the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,067,473
  (+13,604) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 573,188 cases (54%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (01/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases

  in the weeks 10 to 48 (01/12/2020, 12:00 AM)).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and
  age-specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  The first wave of the pandemic in Germany started in week 11 with a high 7-day incidence in 20-59-year-
  olds followed by a rising incidence in the over-80 years old until week 15, which fell again until week 24,
  Since reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence has increased steadily starting in younger age-
  groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups. Among 15-29-year-olds, a slight decrease
  in the weekly incidence can be seen from reporting week 46. With the exception of persons aged 85-89

  at a high level with only slight fluctuations.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 669,619 (63%) of the notified COVID-19 cases. Figure 3 shows
  the percentages of deceased, hospitalized and cases with COVID-19 relevant symptoms. The percentage
  of deaths among cases was less than 1% between week 30 and 42. An increasing trend is visible from
  week 36 to slightly above 1% in weeks 42-46. As deaths occur on average only 2-3 weeks after infection,
  further reports of deaths among currently reported cases are expected for weeks 46-48. The proportion
  of hospitalized COVID-19 cases stabilized at 6% to 7% since week 37. The percentage of cases with
  COVID-19 relevant symptoms increased from 79% in week 37 to 85% in week 48. During the summer
  (weeks 26-36) these proportions were lower at 65% and 77%, likely due to increased testing among
  returning travelers, among whom asymptomatic infections were detected more frequently. The data on
  which the figure is based and that were published here on previous Tuesdays can be found here:

  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 deaths according to week of death for the reporting weeks 10 - 48 (01/12/2020, 12:00
  AM).
  The figures on the first page show the number of deaths reported daily according to date of entry at RKI.
  This may also include cases with a date of death several days in the past. Figure 4 shows the reported
  COVID-19 deaths by calendar week according to the date of death. For recent weeks, further reports of
  deaths among reported cases can be expected.
  The number of deaths has been increasing since week 37; markedly since week 42. Of all deaths, 14,523,
  (87%) were in people aged 70 years or older, with a median age of 83 years, but only 12% of all cases were
  in this age group (Table 3). Thus far, 10 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI, out of which three have been confirmed. Pre-existing medical conditions were
  reported for two of the six cases.

  *Seven of these cases remain under validation.
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  As of 18/11/2020, the number and proportion of persons ≥ 60 years old are reported in each category.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 01/12/2020

  Possible countries of exposure
  In weeks 45 to 48, of the 503,269 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of
  exposure was missing in 269,079 (53%) cases.
  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
  place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0,4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of
  reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting a
  probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined
  again since then. The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the
  summer vacation period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week. Since then, it
  has decreased to currently 468 cases in week 48, and the proportion of all cases with a reported foreign
  place of exposure has decreased significantly to 0.4% in week 48. In weeks 45-48, 3,899 persons
  reported a possible site of infection abroad.
  Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
  quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (402 of 412). There are 23 districts incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and two districts with
  incidences >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person,
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                                0.94                                                            0.89
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.78 – 1.09)                          (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.82– 0.97)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    Figure 6: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 01/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 27/11/2020).
    The reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1 in November. This means that, on average, each
    person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently
    very high in Germany, this means that there is still a high number of new cases every day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

       COVID-19 Situation Report 01/12/2020

   DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
       As of 01/12/2020, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,611
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,151 (80%) are occupied, and 5,460 (20%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.
       Table 5: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (01/12/2020, 12:15 PM).
                                                                Number of patients  Percentage          Change to previous day*
          Currently in ICU                                                  3,919                                                -7

       *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
       patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
       cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
       situation on 01/12/2020. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
       as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
       senior care homes. Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection
       of vulnerable groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new
       infections can be substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
