4   COVID-19 Situation Report 25/03/2020
      Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 24/03/2020. In 13,449 cases, onset of
      symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 3).

      symptoms and alternatively by date of reporting. (25/03/2020, 12:00 AM)
      Further information
      The 149 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 97 men and 52 women. The
      median age was 83 years and the range 42 to 100 years. Of all deaths, 101 (68%) were in persons 80 years or
      older (but only 3% of all cases).
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as high. However, this risk varies from region to region.
      The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The
      burden on the health care system depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and
      initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some
      regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     The following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:
                 o     District of Heinsberg (North Rhine Westphalia) since 12/03/2020
      -     All federal states are implementing measures to enforce social distancing, such as cancellation of mass
            gatherings, closure of cultural institutions such as museums, theaters, concert halls, limiting operation of
            restaurants, bars and clubs, as well as school and daycare closures starting the week of 16/03/2020.
