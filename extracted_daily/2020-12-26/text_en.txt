  The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.

  Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.

  The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 26/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to
      commit itself to infection prevention and control with even greater dedication.
  • Yesterday, 14,455 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 240 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI
      in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 171 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national
      incidence.
  • All of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 336 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
      55 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 6 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
  • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of people ≥60
      years is currently 178 cases/100,000 population and above the national incidence since 23/12/2020.
  • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and
      nursing and long-term care homes.
  • On 26/12/2020 (12:15 PM) 5,535 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the leading 24 hours, +473 existing patients had been
      discharged (36% of which had died) and +620 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of ongoing cases was +147 more than the
      prior day.
  • RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general population as very high.
  • On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Threat Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is
      unknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, one case with the new variant virus has been reported in
      Germany (Baden-Württemberg). Further cases may be expected.
  • On December 25, no daily situation report was released by RKI; the report will also not be released on January 1, 2021. Testing and notification
      activities may be lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete picture of the epidemiological situation in Germany.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 24/12/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well
      as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the rise in cases could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since the beginning of December case numbers have been sharply increasing again.
      The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Nevertheless, the daily number of new cases remains high due to
      the large number of current cases. Furthermore, during the festive season the detection, notification and
      transmission of COVID-19-cases is delayed, thus the R-value may be underestimated.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly in
      households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and educational
      settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without
      traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, the 7-day incidence increases in all age groups, particularly in persons aged 80 years or over. As
      the latter more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is
      also increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of
      infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.
      On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant (B 1.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk
      Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is unknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19
      pandemic. According to ECDC, cases with the new variant have already been detected in Europe, including
      Belgium and Denmark. Iceland, Ireland, France, and Sweden reported cases with this variant to ECDC and
      EU member states. It is expected that infections with the new variant will be detected in further countries.
      So far, one case with the new variant virus has been reported in Germany (Baden-Württemberg). Further
      cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new virus variant detected in South Africa possibly
      associated with higher transmissibility and more severe disease.
      Note: On 25/12/2020 and 01/01/2021 no Daily Situation Report was/will be published.
      Reported COVID-19 cases should be interpreted with care during the festive season as there may be fewer
      medical consultations, less sampling and diagnostic testing during that time. This may lead to fewer notified
      cases at the local level and hence to fewer transmitted COVID-19 cases to the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,627,103
  (+14,455) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 907,459 cases (56%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (26/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
  proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

5                                                                                                                                       5
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
  among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for every district (412/412).
  There are 55 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 6 districts with an incidence of >500
  cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                 0.86                                                            0.89
         (95%-Prädiktionsintervall: 0.73 – 1.0)                           (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.82 – 0,97)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value. During the festive season COVID cases are detected, notified and
  transmitted with delays, thus the R-value may be under-estimated.

    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 26/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 22/12/2020).
    The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Nevertheless, the daily number of new cases remains high due to
    the large number of current cases. Furthermore, during the festive season the detection, notification and
    transmission of COVID-19-cases is delayed, thus the R-value may be underestimated.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 26/12/2020, a total of 1,338 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,540
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,260 (80%) are occupied, and 5,280 (20%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
     population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
     as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households. occupational settings and nursing and
     senior care homes.
     Therefore. more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
     is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
     substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
