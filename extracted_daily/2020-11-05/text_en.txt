COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
– Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
Summary (as of 05/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
• Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
    strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
• The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 126.8 cases per 100,000 population.
• Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
    incidence of people ≥ 60 years has further increased to currently 83.8 cases/100.000 population.
• The 7-day incidence in Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin, Hesse, Saarland and Bavaria is higher than the national
    total 7-day incidence.
• Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 10 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
    today, 125 districts have an incidence of >50-100 cases/100,000 population, 234 districts have an incidence of >100
    cases/100,000 population and of these, 8 districts have an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
• The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
    gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as
    in occupational settings or related to religious events.
• The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care increased in the past 2 weeks from 1,030 patients on
    22/10/2020 to 2,653 patients on 05/11/2020.
• In total, 597,583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,930 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
    to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 05/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has decreased and today is
      approximately 1. This means that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will infect on average one other
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently high in Germany, this means that the daily
      number of newly infected persons will remain high.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 597,583
  (+19,990) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 295,205 cases (49%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (05/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 50% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (402 of 412). By now, 234 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 8 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  125 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse most of the times, with several cases clustering in the context
  of celebrations with family and friends, but increasingly as well in community facilities and retirement
  and nursing homes. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the affected districts. At the same time, many small outbreaks in hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers
  and refugees, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to
  contribute to the increase of incidence.

       Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
       The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
       R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
       extracted from the notification system.
                                           4-day R-value                                                               7-day R-value
                                                0.79                                                                        0.93

       Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
       less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

       The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past days the R-value has
       decreased slightly and is approximately 1 today.
       Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
       As of 05/11/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,612
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,718 (76%) are occupied, and 6,894 (24%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown inTable 3.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
    reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
    in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
Information from additional RKI based surveillance
systems for acute respiratory illnesses
    GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
    (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 44, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
    stable. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further
    information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
    The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
    practices. In week 44, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
    rate) increased. The ARI rate increased in most of the age groups, but remained stable in children aged
    below 5 years. Overall, the number of patients visits due to ARI was higher than in previous seasons at
    this time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 21 of
    41 sentinel samples (51%) in week 44, 2020. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 19 samples (46%)
    and SARS-CoV-2 was found in 2 samples (5%). No influenza virus was detected. Further information can
    be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
    A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
    patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
    the lower respiratory tract). In week 43, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased sharply. The
    number of SARI cases in the age groups above 35 years were at a markedly higher level than in previous
    years, but remained below the usual level for children aged 0 to 14 years. Of all reported SARI cases in
    week 43, 2020, 32% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (See Figure 6). The proportion
    of COVID-19 infections among SARI cases has increased since week 40, 2020. In week 43, 2020 it has
    again reached the high level of weeks 14 and 15, 2020. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among
    SARI cases in week 43, 2020, by age groups can be found in Figure 7. This proportion was highest in the
    age groups 15 to 34 years and 35 to 59 years (41% and 46%, resp.). Please note that due to data
    availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration
    of up to one week were included in this analysis.
