2   COVID-19 Situation Report 10/03/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    Case numbers1
      With over 1,000 cases in Germany, the COVID-19 case numbers can no longer be manually updated and reported
      in a quality assured manner. Therefore, the reporting will be changed. As of today, epidemiological evaluations in
      the COVID-19 situation report will only refer to the electronically transmitted data that are available to the
      Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at the time of the data closure. For a transitional period, the absolute case numbers
      will still be requested from the Länder on a daily base.
      A total of 1,139 (+237) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been detected
      in Germany since 27/01/2020, of which 514 were electronically reported to and validated at the Robert Koch
      Institute. Today, two deaths related to COVID-19 diseases were reported for the first time.
      Information on laboratory-confirmed cases
      So far, 1,139 cases in 15 federal states have been laboratory-confirmed (Table 1).

    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 1,139 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 514 cases from 15 states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 514 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (09/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 286 are male (56%) and 228 female (44%). The age range is from 0 to 82 years, including 10
    children under the age of 5, 11 children aged 5-14 and 427 persons in the age groups 15 to 59 years and 62
    persons 60 years and older (see Figure 2). The age of 4 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 41 years.

    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 07/03/2020. In 232 cases, onset of symptoms
    is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as moderate. However, this risk varies from region to
      region and is higher in "particularly affected areas". The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The burden on the health care system depends on the regional
      distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social
      distancing etc.), and may be very high in some regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of
      new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
