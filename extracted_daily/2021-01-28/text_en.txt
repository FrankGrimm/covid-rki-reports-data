      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
      – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
      Summary (as of 28/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the
          health of the general population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 17,553 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 941 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 98 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,
          Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
      • Of 412 districts, 374 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 171 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000
          population and of these, 6 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 78 and of people ≥80 years 200 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 28/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,437 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +560 existing patients
          had been discharged (28% of whom had died) and +496 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was -64 more than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,738,236 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.1%) and
          366.081 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 28/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of
  COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to decrease in almost all regions.
  The R-value is currently below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this
  means still a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in
  nursing and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many
  districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the
  number of serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a medical mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially
  indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide, for which both their effect on
  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations are being examined in detail. Since mid-
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. By now there is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. There are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with
  variant B.1.1.7 may lead to more severe diseases. At least for the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty by
  BioNTech/Pfizer, an effectiveness against B.1.1.7 could be shown in first studies.
  Also in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. The
  effectiveness of vaccines is currently being tested for this variant as well. Furthermore, a SARS-CoV-2
  variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of Amazonas.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data
  acquisition in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection
  process is increasingly monitored by integrated molecular surveillance.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data
  transmission to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported
  incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,178,828
  (+17,553) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *In Brandenburg. some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by
  the RKI. ** Due to a technical problem today, there has been a difference of four cases between the Dashboard and case
  numbers given here. These problems are currently being resolved.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 1,148,707 cases (53 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (28/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 28/01/2021, a total of 1,280 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 29,957 intensive care
      beds were registered, of which 22,315 (84%) are occupied, and 4,342 (16%) beds are currently available.
      The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for acute respiratory illnesses
      GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
      (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 3, 2021, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased.
      The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further information
      can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
      The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
      practices. In week 3, 2021, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
      rate) decreased. The ARI rate was on a markedly lower level compared to previous years. Within the viral
      surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 27 of 158 sentinel samples (17%) in week 3,
      2021. Among those, SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 samples (11%), rhinovirus in 9 samples (6%) and
      human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) was found in one sample (1%). Since week 40, 2020, SARS-COV-2
      has been found in 154 (11%) of 1,762 samples, whereas hCoV has been found in 3 of 1,529 samples.
      Influenza virus or Respiratory Syncitial Virus have been detected none of the 1,770 samples tested since
      week 40, 2020. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
      A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
      patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
      the lower respiratory tract). In week 2, 2021, the number of SARI cases decreased in all age groups
      except for the age group 35 to 59 years, where case numbers remained on a high level. The number of

    SARI cases aged below 35 years were markedly lower than usual at this time of the year. The SARI case
    numbers were still high in the age groups 35 years and above.
    Since week 45, 2020, more than half of the reported SARI cases per week have been diagnosed with
    COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). In week 2, 2021, the proportion of COVID-19 infections
    increased slightly to 71%. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age groups can be found
    in Table 4. The proportions of COVID-19 cases in all age groups in the weeks 40, 2020 to 1, 2021 have
    been more than twice as high as in spring (weeks 12 to 20, 2020). In week 2, 2021, the proportion of
    COVID-19 cases in the age groups above 14 years remained high, comprising more than half of the SARI
    cases in this week. This proportion was highest in SARI cases aged between 35 to 59 years at 81%.
    Within the 72 sentinel hospitals, there was no COVID-19 case among SARI patients below 15 years of age
    in week 2, 2021. Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as
    the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

  Data on emergency department utilization
      In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
      and with the ESEG project partners
      (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/ESEG/ESEG_node.html), the RKI analyses
      emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
      https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html
      Within the emergency department situation report of the 27 January 2021, data from 22 emergency
      departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 24 January 2021. In week 3-
      2021, 11,194 admissions were recorded; which was a +2.9% change compared to last week, and a -
      30.8% average change compared to the mean of the pre-pandemic year 2019 (see Figure 5).
      Figure 5: Relative deviation of admissions in each emergency department compared to its mean in 2019, from January 2019 to
      January 2021 (as of 27 January 2021), averaged over all emergency departments.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the
      general population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2
      transmission as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and
      nursing and senior care homes.
      Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable
      groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections
      can be reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the
      new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

 Annex
    1
      The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former
    cases may be included.
    2
      Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
    number of recovered cases.
    3
      The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and
    hospitalization but not for late effects because such data were not recorded regularly.
    4
      Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are
    reported.
