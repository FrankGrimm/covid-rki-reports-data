     Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
   3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
     data were not recorded regularly.
      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

     Summary (as of 03/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
     • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general
          population as very high.
     • Yesterday, 10,315 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 312 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI
          in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 140 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national
          incidence.
     • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 288 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 41
          districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
     • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 115 and of people ≥80 years 287 cases/100,000 population.
     • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and
          nursing and long-term care homes.
     • On 03/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 5,762 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 429 existing patients were discharged
          (42% of whom had died) and 465 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was +36 more than the prior
          day.
     • On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC published a Risk Assessment on 29/12/2020. To date, it is unknown how
          the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, a few cases of this new variant have been transmitted to the RKI. Further cases
          may be expected.
     • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 238,809 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
     • Testing and notification activities may be lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete picture of the epidemiological
          situation in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 03/01/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
      detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
      following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
      19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the rise in cases could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since the beginning of December case numbers have been sharply increasing again.
      The R-value is currently around 1. Nevertheless, the daily number of new cases remains high due to the
      large number of current cases. Furthermore, during the festive season the detection, notification and
      transmission of COVID-19-cases is delayed, thus the R-value may be underestimated.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly in
      households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings.
      Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable
      transmission chains.
      Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
      serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.
      On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Risk
      Assessment on 29/12/2020. To date, it is unknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19
      pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been detected in numerous countries around the world.
      It is expected that infections with the new variant will be detected in further countries. So far, a few cases
      of this new variant have been transmitted to the RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also
      reported another new virus variant detected in South Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility
      and more severe disease.
      COVID-19 cases reported during the festive season and the first few days of the new year must be
      interpreted with caution as there may be fewer medical consultations, less sampling and diagnostic testing
      during that time. This may lead to fewer notified cases at the local level and hence to fewer transmitted
      COVID-19 cases to the RKI. Furthermore, not all local and state health authorities transmit data to the RKI
      on all days.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,765,666
  (+10.315) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 987,429 cases (56%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
    information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
    COVID-19 cases.
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
    numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
    proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
  among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for every district (412/412).
  There are 41 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 2 districts with an incidence of >500
  cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  continue to contribute to the elevated incidence particularly in households and retirement and nursing
  homes, but also in various occupational settings, hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  and in the context of religious gatherings.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                         7-day R-value
                                1.11                                                                0.91
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.93 – 1.33)                                    (95%-prediction interval: 0.82 – 0.99)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value. During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and
  transmitted with delays, thus the R-value may be under-estimated.

  without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset electronically

     COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 03/01/2021, 12 AM, considering cases up to 30/12/2020).
     *During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
     The R-value is currently around 1. Nevertheless, the daily number of new cases remains high due to the
     large number of current cases. Furthermore, during the festive season the detection, notification and
     transmission of COVID-19-cases is delayed, thus the R-value may be underestimated.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
     https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from
     23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 03/01/2021, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,551
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,894 (82%) are occupied, and 4,657 (18%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
     population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
     as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households. occupational settings and nursing and
     senior care homes.
     Therefore. more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
     is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
     substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
