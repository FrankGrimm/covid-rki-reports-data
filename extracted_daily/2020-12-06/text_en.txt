  The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to the delay of data transmission, cases from previous days may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data are not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 06/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
        encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin and Thuringia is considerably, in Saxony even more considerably higher than the
        national total 7-day incidence of 142 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 128 cases/100,000 population.
    • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 10 districts transmitted an incidence of ≤25
        cases/100,000 population. In comparison, 279 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
        30 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and two districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
        households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to
        religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • After the strong increase in the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care until mid-November (3,395 cases on
        15/11/2020), the increase has slowed somewhat, with 4,108 cases on 06/12/2020.
    • On 06/12/2020, 17,767 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 255 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
        been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 06/12/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. The increase has leveled off since
      the second week of November. In November, the reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1 with
      a rising trend during the last days. An R-value around 1 means that, on average, each person infected
      with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in
      Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly
      in households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and
      educational settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2
      without traceable transmission chains.
      While the 7-day-incidence among younger age groups is stable or slightly decreasing, the incidence
      among older people is further increasing. As the latter more often have more severe illness due to
      COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent
      the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,171,323
  (+17,767) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown for 633,141 cases (54%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

                                                              Onset of symptoms   Date of reporting

    unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (06/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
    information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
    reported COVID-19 cases.
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
    numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
    according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
    persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
    particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36 IfSG.
    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
    As of 18/11/2020, the number and proportion of persons ≥60 years old are reported in each category.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (402 of 412). There are 30 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and two districts with
  an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                              7-day R-value
                                 1.21                                                                     1.10
          (95%-prediction interval: 1.03 – 1.42)                                      (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 1.00 – 1.22)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

  Figure 3: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 06/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 02/12/2020).
  The reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1 in November, with a rising trend during the last
  days. An R-value around 1 means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects
  another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that
  there is still a high number of new infections every day.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 06/12/2020, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,178
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,639 (80%) are occupied, and 5,539 (20%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
     situation on 01/12/2020. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
     as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
     senior care homes. Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection
     of vulnerable groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new
     infections can be substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
