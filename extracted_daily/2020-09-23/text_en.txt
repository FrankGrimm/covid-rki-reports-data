 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. Since 14/09/2020 the
 RKI situation report will be published in a shortened version. The report will be more focused on the current situation. Demographic and clinical
 aspects, for which there are only few daily changes, will be presented once a week and in a weekly comparison. Further data is also available in
 the COVID 19 dashboard: https://corona.rki.de

  Summary (as of 23/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
       After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
        COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must
        still be carefully monitored.
       The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 13.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
        The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2 districts: the cities of Hamm and
        Remscheid. A total of 10 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
       The 7-day incidence in Bavaria and Berlin is considerably higher, in Baden-Wuerttemberg and
        Hamburg noticeably higher, and in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bremen slightly higher than the
        national mean 7-day incidence.
       In total, 275,927 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,409 deaths associated with COVID-19
        have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
       A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
        clusters occur particularly in nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and
        refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family
        events and among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 23/09/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
    confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
    cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as
    cases of COVID-19 disease.
    General current assessment
    After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, further increase is currently observed in
    the population of Germany. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly
    increasing, while the proportion of cases among travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The
    R-value is currently below 1.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different situations,
    including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends or, especially in cases among younger people,
    outbreaks originating from travel returnees.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The number of deaths among reported
    COVID-19 cases is currently low. This is mainly due to the relatively high proportion of younger people
    among newly diagnosed cases in the last weeks, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. If the trend
    continues and more elderly and vulnerable people get infected, an increase in hospitalisations and deaths is
    to be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 275,927
  (+1,769) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
  RKI (Table 1). A total of 10 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a total of
  139 districts reported zero cases.

     Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
     transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
     Distribution of cases over time
     The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
     transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
     of symptoms is unknown for 101,354 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (23/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  In 34 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
  the cities of Hamm and Remscheid, with 7-day incidences of > 50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to over 99 cases in connection with a
  wedding. More than 300 identified guests are quarantined and required to be tested. Stricter distancing
  measures have been implemented in Hamm.
  Recent infections in the city of Remscheid were mainly found among contact persons of confirmed cases
  and can be attributed mostly to families that have returned from holidays: Several schools and nurseries
  are affected. Increased measures (e. g. broad quarantine) have been implemented.
  The increased incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to transmission during family and other
  private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing.
  The number of COVID-19-related outbreaks reported in nursing homes; hospitals, facilities for asylum
  seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious
  events has increased.

     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.
                            4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value

           (95%-prediction interval: 0.65 – 0.95)                               (95%-prediction interval: 0.87 – 1.04)
     Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
     cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
     electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 23/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 19/09/2020).
     The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Despite the current situation with R values
     below 1 (since 22/09/2020) the trend has to be watched carefully.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
     23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 23/09/2020, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,595
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,896 (72%) are occupied, and 8,699 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
    reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
    in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
    well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
    data are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test
    laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
    Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
    the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 38/2020, 15,642,654 laboratory tests
    have been recorded to date, 312,964 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Up to and including week 38, 252 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
    one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the
    ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the
    same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
    (Table 4).

      Testing of travellers at German points of entry
      At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres
      have been established. Some of the laboratories attached to those test centres have voluntarily provided
      aggregated statistics on the number of tests. For week 38/2020, 78,205 tests were reported from these
      entry points, of which 665 were positive (0.85%). It is not possible to say to which extent these 78,205
      tests are included in those reported in Table .
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
      dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
      worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
      beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased markedly. Many of these cases were
      associated with travellers. Since calendar week 35 transmissions within Germany can be observed to a
      larger extent. Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in
      connection with celebrations with family and friends and at group events. There are still no approved
      vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
      The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
      very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
      play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
      indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m is
      maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained,
      e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of
      transmission outdoors.
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
      individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
      previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
      Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
      main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
      (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
      rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
