COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 08/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed.
     Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and
     control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 22.2 cases per 100,000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in Hamburg, North Rhine-
     Westphalia and Hesse moderately higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • The district Neukoelln in Berlin exceeded 100 cases/100,000 population. The 7-day incidence
     exceeded 50 cases/100,000 population in 14 districts. In a further 79 districts, it exceeded 25
     cases/100,000 population.
  • Since calendar week 36 the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
     clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
     and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
     settings, and among travellers.
  • In total, 314,660 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,589 deaths associated with COVID-19
     have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 08/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The R-value has been predominantly higher than 1
      since the beginning of September.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can only be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 314,660
  (+4,516) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 120.701 cases (38%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (09/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
   missing in 27% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
   reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
   above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
   facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
   The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 42 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 94 districts,
  including the city of Hamm, the district of Cloppenburg, the city of Rosenheim, the city of Offenbach, the
  city of Bremen, the district of Vechta, the city of Herne, the city of Frankfurt/Main, the district of
  Esslingen, the district of Wesermarsch, the city of Remscheid and in the city of Berlin the following
  districts: Neukoelln, Mitte, Tempelhof-Schoeneberg and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, with 7-day incidences
  of >50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to about 200 cases in connection with a
  wedding. More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine. Stricter distancing
  measures have been implemented in Hamm.
  The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin (Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Mitte, Neukoelln, Tempelhof-
  Schoeneberg) is due to more diffuse transmission. Stricter distancing rules and opening restrictions for
  restaurants, bars and shops will apply from 10/10/2020.
  In the district of Vechta, an outbreak occurred in a long-term care facility with a total of 50 cases among
  staff and residents. The outbreak has currently infected 100 people in the district with the corona virus.
  Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to a diffuse transmission with cases among family and
  other private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of
  COVID-19-related outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and
  refugees, community facilities, schools and kindergarten, various occupational settings and in connection
  with religious events has increased.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

       Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
       The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
       R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
       extracted from the notification system.

       The reported R values have been predominantly higher than 1 since the beginning of September.
       Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
       As of 08/10/2020, a total of 1,279 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,258
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,739 (72%) are occupied, and 8,519 (28%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
       Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
 Mortality Monitoring
     A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
     excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
     the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
     (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data
     have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
     monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
     An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
     April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also among
     those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
     Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. All-cause mortality for the countries in the EuroMOMO network
     has now largely returned to expected levels even if in some countries there seems to be a small excess
     mortality.
     Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with a
     certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
     https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
     Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
     Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
     of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
     significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
     of May. In calendar week 37, 2020 (07/10 – 13/10/2020), 16,626 people deceased (-181 compared to
     week 36).
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     epidemiologic situation on 07/10/2020. The current version can be found here: Risk assessment for
     COVID-19 (in German)
