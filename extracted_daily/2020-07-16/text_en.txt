    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown in 60.561 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
    on gender was reported, 5,396 were children under 10 years of age (2.7%), 9,940 children and teenagers
    aged 10 to 19 years (5,0%), 88.401 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 60,200 persons aged 50 to 69
    years (30%), 30,488 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,390 persons aged 90 years and older
    (2.7%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 445 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48 years
    (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (16/07/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 170,886 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,148 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 4,082 of 27,356 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,881 (17%) of 174,686 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 186,400 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,078 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.5% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 5,016 (55%) are men and 4,057 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases. The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,768 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 16/07/2020
6
      The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
      consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
      among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
      reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
      persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
      Outbreaks
      A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in one district:
      the district of Bad Toelz-Wolfrathshausen (Bavaria).
      In this district a higher incidence of of cases was observed in two refugee facilities. Appropriate
      containment measures were implemented.
      The 7-day incidence in the district of Guetersloh that had been caused by an outbreak in a meat
      processing plant has steadily decreased to now below 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
      A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
      well as religious communities.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

      A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
      estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
      This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
      outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
      affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
      relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the case in
      Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.10 (95%-prediction interval: 0.85 – 1.33) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 16/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.07 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.93 – 1.21) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 16/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 16/07/2020, a total of 1,272 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,514
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,533 (66%) are occupied, and 10,981 beds (34%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Data on emergency department utilisation
      In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
      the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
      https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html
      As of 12/07/2020, data from 10 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between
      01/11/2019 and 01/03/2020, an average of 6,608 emergency department admissions per week was
      recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was
      observed, to 3,969 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable
      surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions,
      public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase
      in admissions has been observed. In week 28 2020, 6,113 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the
      number of admissions is currently 7% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see
      Figure 5).

  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for actue respiratory illnesses
       GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
       (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 28, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased,
       mainly among children under 15 years of age. Further information can be found under
       https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
       The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
       practices. In week 28, 2020, the number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections increased
       for all age groups, but remained at a low level overall that matches the level of previous season at this
       time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 30 of 42 samples
       (72%) in week 28, 2020. Since week 16, 2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected within the viral
       surveillance of the AGI. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
       A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
       patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
       the lower respiratory tract). In week 27, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased, but remains at
       a low level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 27, 2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code
       U07.1!) (See Figure 6). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for
       SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
        transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
        German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
        short notice based on new insights.
        Infection risk
        The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
        behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.
        Disease severity
        In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
        increasing age and underlying illnesses.
        Burden on health system
        The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
        capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
        burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
