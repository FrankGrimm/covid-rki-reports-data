COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

        Summary (as of 12/09/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    After a high increase between calendar week 29 and 34, the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has
             stabilized since calendar week 35. Even if the number of new cases does not increase significantly
             at the moment, the situation must still be carefully monitored.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 10.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
             A total of 17 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 132 districts the 7-
             day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Bavaria, Hamburg, Berlin and Baden-Wuerttemberg the 7-day incidence is considerably higher
             than the national mean 7-day incidence, while in Hesse it is slightly higher.
        •    In total, 258,480 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,347 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing
             homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various
             occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 12/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory confirmed
    cases of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of clinical symptoms and disease severity. Thus, in the following report
    the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July has now stabilized at a slightly higher level. The
    R-value is currently around 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks more young people have become
    infected, thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
    situations, e.g. larger celebrations in the family and among friends. In addition, COVID-19 cases are
    identified to a large extent among travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the proportion of
    deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of younger people
    among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A renewed increase in
    new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a renewed increase
    among the elderly and vulnerable groups of the population, as was the case at the beginning of the
    pandemic. If more elderly and vulnerable people become infected again, a renewed increase in
    hospitalizations and deaths must be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 258,480
    (+1,630) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (see Table 1). A total of 17 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 the
    number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 92,574 cases (36%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

   Clinical aspects
   Approximately 231,400 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,347 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.6% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,181 (55%) are men and 4,162 (45%) are women (Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years).
  Of all deaths, 7,975 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 15% of all cases were in this
   age group. So far, two deaths among COVID-19 cases younger than 20 years have been reported to the
   RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for both of them. The number of deaths may change
   after data validation is completed.

   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
   missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
   reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
   above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
   facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 3).
   The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  In 17 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
  the urban districts of Rosenheim, Würzburg and Kaufbeuren in Bavaria, where the incidence is > 50
  cases/100,000 population. Most affected districts are in the federal state of Bavaria. The increased
  incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but
  also to transmission during family and other private events.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.

    Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for

    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 12/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 08/09/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.15 (95%-prediction interval: 0.89 - 1.40) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 12/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.16 (95% prediction
    interval: 1.01 - 1.32) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 12/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
    The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are below or
    around 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers,
    particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number
    of smaller outbreaks.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7-
    day R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values
    can also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
      dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
      worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
      beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week.
      Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with
      celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age
      groups, have also contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no
      approved vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
      The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
      very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
      play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
      indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
      is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
      maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
      risk of transmission outdoors.
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
      individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
      previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
      Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
      main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
      (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
      rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
