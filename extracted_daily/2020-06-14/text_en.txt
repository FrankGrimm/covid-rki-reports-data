COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Law (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recored nationwide data
on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Distribution of cases over time
    Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by date of symptom onset or alternatively by
    date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (14/06/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Approximately 172,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    In total, 8,787 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.7% of all confirmed cases).
    So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-
    existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 26% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence rate was observed in four districts, primarily due to localised outbreaks: The
    districts of Aichach-Friedberg and Coburg (both Bavaria) and the districts of Greiz and Sonneberg (both
    Thuringia).
    In Aichach-Friedberg an outbreak was reported among seasonal harvest workers. Tracing and testing of
    contacts as well as implementation of hygiene and quarantine measures were rapidly implemented.
    Harvest activities were temporarily halted.
    In the districts of Greiz and Sonneberg as well as in the district Coburg outbreaks in nursing homes for
    the elderly were observed, where residents and partly also employees were infected with SARS-CoV-2.
    Declining numbers can be observed in other cities/ districts with previously high 7-day incidences. In the
    city of Bremerhaven an outbreak extending to other districts, including Cuxhaven, occurred within a
    religious community. Another outbreak occurred following a large family gathering.
    A large COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the district of Göttingen related to family gatherings, for which a
    large number of contact persons has been identified. Due to a high number of affected children,
    numerous schools and day care institutions were temporarily closed.
    Outbreaks continue to occur in meat-processing plants in several federal states, some of which have led
    to the closures of plants. From Berlin, Hesse and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, outbreaks were
    reported among members of religious communities. In addition, several large outbreaks occurred
    among workers at logistics companies, for instance in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true

      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 14/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 10/06/2020).
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day-R-value is 1.05 (95%-prediction interval: 0.85 – 1.29)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 14/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.00 (95% predictation
      interval: 0.88– 1.13) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 14/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
  Measures taken by Germany
       -     From 15 June, borders will open within Europe, making travel possible again – provided the
             COVID-19 activity in destination countries permits this (12/06/2020) https://www.auswaertiges-
             amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/covid-19/2296762
       -     Information on additional regulations at the regional level regarding control measures such as
             physical distancing or quarantine regulations for persons entering from other countries can be
             accessed here: https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/corona-
