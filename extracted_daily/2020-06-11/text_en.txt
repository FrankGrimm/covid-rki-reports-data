    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among notified cases with data on gender,
    4,048 were children under 10 years of age (2.2%), 8,476 children and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years
    (4.6%), 80,454 persons aged 20 to 49 years (43%), 57,450 persons aged 50 to 69 years (31%), 29,621
    persons aged 70 to 89 years (16%) and 5,263 persons aged 90 years and older (2.8%). The age is
    unknown in 104 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 49 years (median age 49 years). The highest
    incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (11.06.2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 158,459 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 4,777 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 2,505 of 16,745 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 28,187 (18%) of 159,717 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 171,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    In total, 8,755 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.7% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,846 (55%) are men and 3,904 (45%) are women (see Table 2; gender was unknown in five
    cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,522 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or older,
    but only 19% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under
    20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all
    three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law (IfSG), the RKI receives information on
    occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19
    cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 27% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    So far, 13,339 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence rate was observed in seven cities or districts, primarily due to localised
    outbreaks: The districts of Aichach-Friedberg (Bavaria), Sonneberg (Thuringia), Göttingen (Lower
    Saxony), Coburg (Bavaria), Hersfeld-Rothenburg (Hesse), Cuxhaven (Lower Saxony) and the city of
    Bremerhaven (Bremen).

    In the district of Aichach-Friedberg an outbreak was reported among seasonal harvest workers. Tracing
    and testing of contacts as well as implementation of hygiene and quarantine measures were rapidly
    implemented. Harvest activities were temporarily halted.
    In the city of Bremerhaven an outbreak extending to other districts, including Cuxhaven, occurred within
    a religious community. Another outbreak occurred following a large family gathering.
    In addition an outbreak occurred in a nursing home for the elderly in the district of Sonneberg, in which
    both residents and employees were infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the neighbouring district of Coburg an
    increased number of SARS-CoV-2 infections were also reported in nursing homes, some in conjunction
    with dialysis treatment.
    A large Covid-19 outbreak occurred in the district of Göttingen related to family gatherings, for which a
    large number of contact persons has been identified. Due to a high number of affected children,
    numerous schools and day care institutions were temporarily closed.
    Outbreaks continue to occur in meat-processing plants in several federal states, some of which have led
    to closures of plants.
    Outbreaks in the context of religious communities have been reported from Berlin, Hessen and
    Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
    In addition, several large outbreaks have occurred among workers at logistics companies, for instance in
    North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19 cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as transmission
    to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true temporal
    progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this analysis.
    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset (light
    blue) (as of 11.06.2020 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 05/06/2020).

7                                                                                                                   7
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.
    The R-value reported to date reflects the trend in the number of incident cases with a high degree of
    sensitivity. This value is thus sensitive to short-term changes in the number of cases - such as those
    caused by individual outbreaks - which can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total
    number of new cases is relatively low. In addition to this sensitive R-value, the RKI therefore now
    provides a second, more stable 7-day R-value, which is based on data from a longer time period and is
    therefore less subject to short-term fluctuations. Thus, it reflects trends more reliably, but is based on
    infections that occurred on average earlier than those on which the more sensitive R-value is based.
    Both R-values are estimated on the basis of nowcasting. The nowcasting predicts the number of cases
    with illness onset up to the date of 4 days ago, as no reliable prediction can be made about the number
    of new cases in the last 3 days.
    The sensitive R-value reported so far can be estimated using a moving 4-day average of the number of
    incidenct cases as estimated by nowcasting. It compares the 4-day mean of incident cases on one day
    with the corresponding mean 4 days before. Thus, taking into account that infection occurs four to six
    days before the onset of symptoms, the daily sensitive R-value represents the course of infection
    approximately one to two weeks ago. This value is sentitive to short-term changes, e.g. due to local
    outbreaks, especially, if the number of new cases is relatively low. The current estimate is R = 0.88 (95%-
    prediction interval: 0.69 – 1.08) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 11.06.2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively. The 7-day R-value then compares the 7-day average of
    the new cases on one day with the 7-day average four days earlier. The 7-day R thus represents a
    slightly later course of infection of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is
    estimated at 0.99 (95% predictation interval: 0.89– 1.09) and is based on electronically notified cases as
    of 11.06.2020, 12:00 AM.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable R-
    value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
    also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
    A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from

    DIVI intensive care register
    A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
    RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
    well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
    (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
    number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
    hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
    As of 11.06.2020, a total of 1,274 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 31,998
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,708 (65%) are occupied, and 11,290 beds (35%) are
    currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals
    (with large differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the
    cumulative number of discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
    * Bei der Interpretation der Zahlen muss beachtet werden, dass die Anzahl der meldenden Standorte
    (die auch große Unterschiede in der Bettenzahl aufweisen) täglich schwankt. Dadurch kann es auch zu
    einer Abnahme der kumulativen abgeschlossenen Behandlungen und Todesfällen im Vergleich zum
    Vortag kommen.
    Information from additional RKI-based surveillance systems for acute respiratory illnesses
    GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
    (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 23, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased
    slightly. Since the end of the influenza epidemic in week 12, 2020, the ARI rate has been markedly lower
    than in previous seasons at this time of the year. Further information can be found under
    https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
    The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
    practices. In week 23, 2020, the number of patient visits due to respiratory infections decreased, thus
    remaining at a very low level. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 3 of 26
    samples (12%) in week 23, 2020. Since week 15, 2020, no influenza activity has been observed within
    the viral surveillance of the AGI. No SARS-COV-2 has been detected since week 16, 2020. Further
    information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
    A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
    patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
    the lower respiratory tract). In week 22, 2020, the total number of SARI cases decreased to an unusually
    low level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 22, 2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code
    U07.1!). The proportion of COVID-19 cases has been decreasing since week 14, 2020 (See Figure 5).
    Please note that only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation
    duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
       German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
