COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data
on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 04/07/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
              total of 119 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 196,096 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,010 deaths due to COVID-19 have
              been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •     COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported sporadically in nursing homes, hospitals refugee
              facilities and religious communities.
        •     Outbreaks of COVID-19 in meat processing plants have been reported in several federal states. In
              the district of Guetersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, such an outbreak has led to a high 7-day
              incidence of over 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. In Figure 1 shows COVID-19
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown in 58,587 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
    Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by date of symptom onset or –if unknown–
    alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (04/07/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Approximately 181,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    In total, 9,010 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-
    existing medical conditions were reported for all three.
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in two districts,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia) and the district of Germersheim (Rhineland-
    Palatinate) .
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
    processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
    for SARS-CoV-2. The first employees were discharge from quarantine 14 days after being tested positive
    for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 hours after resolution of symptoms.
    In the district of Germersheim, an increase in COVID-19 cases was observed in connection with a
    religious community.
    A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
    well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
    analysis.

    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
    cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
    ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
    individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
    cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.93 (95%-prediction interval: 0.75 – 1.12)
    and is based on electronically notified cases as of 04/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.94 (95% prediction
    interval: 0.85 – 1.06) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 04/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    In Mid-June, the estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) temporarily increased,
    but have since again decreased to a value of 1 or below. The marked increase was related to increased
    case numbers mainly due to local, outbreak-related COVID-19 transmission with the outbreak in North
    Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role (see section “Outbreaks”, above). The outbreak
    dynamics are also influenced in part by serial tests performed among possibly exposed persons, which
    led to the rapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases in some of the outbreak
    settings. Since the case numbers in Germany are at a low level overall, local outbreaks have a relatively
    strong influence on the value of the reproduction number. For this reason, the reproduction numbers
    may continue to fluctuate markedly.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
    R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
    also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported sporadically.
       The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and as very
       high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
