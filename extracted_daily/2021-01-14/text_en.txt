       The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.
    2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
       data were not recorded regularly.
    4 Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sunday, no updated figures are reported.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

       Summary (as of 14/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
       • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general
           population as very high.
       • Yesterday, 25,164 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,244 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the
           RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 151 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony, Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt it is markedly above
           the national incidence.
       • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 310 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
           51 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and one district have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.
       • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 118 and of people ≥80 years 305 cases/100,000 population.
       • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,
           occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
       • On 14/01/2021, 5,125 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 604 existing patients had been discharged (31 % of
           whom had died) and 544 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 60 less than the prior day.
       • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 842.455 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (10,1 vaccinated per 1,000 population)
           (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 14/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
  19 disease.
  General current assessment
  Since the beginning of December, there has been a renewed sharp rise in the number of cases. During the
  holidays, the number of cases decreased. In the last few days, the number of cases has risen again. Whether
  this trend will continue, beyond the expected retesting and re-reporting, will only become clear in the
  course of the next few days.
  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this means
  a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is an
  increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
  should be avoided.
  On 19/12/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. To date, it is unknown how the new
  virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been detected in
  numerous countries around the world. So far, a few cases of this new variant in Germany have been
  reported to the RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new virus variant
  detected in South Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility and more severe disease. Isolates
  of this lineage have also been identified sporadically in Germany.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission
  to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case
  numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,978,590
  (+25,164) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  * In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the
  RKI.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,085,200 cases (55 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (14/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported in all 412 districts. There
  are 51 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days and there was one district
  with an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard shows all affected districts
  (https://corona.rki.de).
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is known
  to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated
  incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
      with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
      with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 14/01/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,999
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,616 (84 %) are occupied, and 4,383 (16 %) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for acute respiratory illnesses
      GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
      utilizing information from the population. In week 1, 2021, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased further in
      adults aged between 15 and 59 years. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since
      week 36, 2020. Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
      The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
      practices. In week 1, 2021, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
      rate) increased. The ARI rate was on a level comparable to the previous turns of the year in previous
      seasons. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 34 of 138 sentinel
      samples (25%) in week 1, 2021. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 14 samples (10%) and SARS-CoV-
      2 was found in 20 samples (14%). Since week 40, 2020, SARS-COV-2 has been found in 122 (8%) of 1,460
      samples. Influenza virus or Respiratory Syncitial Virus have been detected none of the 1,466 samples tested
      since week 40, 2020. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
      A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
      (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
      respiratory tract). In week 53, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable. The number of SARI
      cases in the age groups below 60 years decreased, whereas the number of cases aged 60 years and above
      increased once again to a high level, comparable to the level at the peak of previous influenza seasons. The
      number of SARI cases in children aged 0 to 14 years has been below the usual level since week 40, 2020.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    Since week 45, 2020, more than half of the reported SARI cases per week have been diagnosed with COVID-
    19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). In week 53, 2020, the proportion of COVID-19 infections remained on a
    high level at 71%. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age groups can be found in Table 3.
    The proportions of COVID-19 cases in all age groups in the weeks 40 to 52, 2020 have been more than twice
    as high as in spring (weeks 12 to 20, 2020). In week 53, 2020, the proportion of COVID-19 cases was
    exceptionally high in the age groups above 14 years, comprising at least 70% of the SARI cases in this week.
    This proportion was highest in SARI cases aged between 15 to 34 years at 88%. Within the 72 sentinel
    hospitals, there was one COVID-19 case among SARI patients below 15 years of age in week 53, 2020.
    Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis
    and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

  Data on emergency department utilization
      In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/), and
      with the ESEG project partners
      (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/ESEG/ESEG_node.html), the RKI analyses
      emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
      https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
      Within the emergency department situation report of the 13 January 2021, data from 21 emergency
      departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 10 January 2021. In week 1-
      2021, 10,274 admissions were recorded; which was a -12.2% change compared to last week, and a -33.4%
      average change compared to the mean of the pre-pandemic year 2019 (see Figure 5).
      Figure 5: Relative deviation of admissions in each emergency department compared to its mean in 2019, from January 2019 to
      January 2021 (as of 13 January 2021), averaged over all emergency departments.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
      as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
      senior care homes.
      Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
      is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
      reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-
      CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:
