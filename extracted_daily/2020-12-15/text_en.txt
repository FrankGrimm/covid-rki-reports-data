  The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 15/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
        encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.
    • Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 174 cases per 100,000
        population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is severely, in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse and Saarland considerably
        above the overall incidence.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of
        people ≥60 years is currently 164 cases/100,000 population.
    • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 1 district has an incidence of ≤25 cases/100,000
        population. In comparison, 345 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 54 districts have an
        incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
        households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious
        events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • With 4,735 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.
    • On 14/12/2020, 14,432 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 500
        new deaths associated with COVID-19.
    • RKI’s risk assessment was updated. RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population as very high.
    • The state of Saxony did not report any data since yesterday. Particularly the 7-day-incidence but other values as well are therefore
        nationally but especially in regard to Saxony lower than the actual values.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 15/12/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the rise in cases could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since 04/12/2020 case numbers have been sharply increasing again.
      The R-value is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2
      infects another person. The R-value can only be used to a limited extent today, since data transmissions
      are pending. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a high
      and increasing number of new infections every day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly
      in households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and
      educational settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2
      without traceable transmission chains.
      While the 7-day-incidence among younger age groups is stable or slightly decreasing, the incidence
      among older people is further increasing. As the latter more often have more severe illness due to
      COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent
      the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,351,510
  (+14,432) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 740,560 cases (55%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (15/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Figure 2: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=1,188,511 cases with respective data
  in the weeks 10 to 50 (15/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and
  age-specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  The first wave of the pandemic in Germany started in week 11 with a high 7-day incidence in 20-59-year-
  olds followed by a rising incidence in the over-80 years old until week 15, which fell again until week 24,
  Since reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence has increased steadily starting in younger age-
  groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups. Currently, an increase of the 7-day
  incidence can be seen in all age groups, especially in the age groups 80 years and older.

  The percentage of cases with COVID-19 relevant symptoms increased from 79% in week 37 to 86% in
  week 49. During the summer (weeks 26-36) these proportions were lower at 65% and 77%. During that
  time period returning travelers were increasingly tested, among whom asymptomatic infections were
  detected more frequently. The data on which the figure is based and that were published here on
  previous Tuesdays can be found at: www.rki.de/covid-19-tabelle-klinische-aspekte

  A significant increase in the number of deaths was observed since week 37. 19,663 (88%) of deaths were
  among people aged 70 years or older, with a median age of 83 years, while this age group accounts for
  only 13% of all cases (Table 3). Thus far, 12 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI. Child deaths are still being validated.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in many cases, the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above-mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of
  cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.

  Possible countries of exposure
  In weeks 46 to 50, of the 659,624 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of
  exposure was missing in 346,985 (53%) cases. In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46%
  for cases that had a possible foreign country as place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0,4% in
  reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions.
  As of reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases
  reporting a probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and
  declined again since then. The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end
  of the summer vacation period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week. Since
  then, it has decreased to currently 294 cases in week 50. The proportion of all cases with a reported
  foreign place of exposure has decreased significantly to 1% in week 50. In weeks 46-50, 2,699 persons
  reported a possible site of infection abroad.
  Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
  quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende ).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 15/12/2020

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (411 of 412). There are 54 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 2 districts with an
  incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                               0.95*                                                           0.98*
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.83 – 1.09)                          (95%- prediction interval: 0.91 – 1.05)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
  *Due to pending data transmissions today, these R-values should be interpreted with caution
  Figure 5: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 15/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 11/12/2020).
    The R-value is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2
    infects another person. The R-value can only be used to a limited extent today, since data transmissions
    are pending. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a high
    and increasing number of new infections every day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
    collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
    well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
    16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
    (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).

    *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
    patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
    cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.

       COVID-19 Situation Report 15/12/2020
10
       As of 15/12/2020, a total of 1,290 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,153
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,471 (83%) are occupied, and 4,682 (17%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
       situation on 11/12/2020. The RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general population to be
       very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as the
       occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and senior care
       homes. Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of
       vulnerable groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new
       infections can be substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
