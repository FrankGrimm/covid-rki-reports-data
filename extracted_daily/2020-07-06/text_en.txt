        Summary (as of 06/07/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 2.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
              total of 126 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 196,554 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,016 deaths due to COVID-19 have
              been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •     COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported sporadically in nursing homes and hospitals refugee
              facilities and religious communities.
        •     Outbreaks of COVID-19 in meat processing plants have been reported in several federal states. In
              the district of Guetersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, such an outbreak led to a high 7-day
              incidence of over 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown in 58,888 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
    on gender was reported, 5,005 were children under 10 years of age (2.6%), 9,555 children and teenagers
    aged 10 to 19 years (4.9%), 86,421 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 59,519 persons aged 50 to 69
    years (30%), 30,279 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,359 persons aged 90 years and older
    (2.7%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 416 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48 years
    (median age 49 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (06/07/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 167,913 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,080 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,630 of 24,565 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,459 (17%) of 171,294 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 182,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,934 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (Section 42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing
    plants.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 06/07/2020

      Outbreaks
      A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in two districts,
      the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia) and the district of Dingolfing-Landau (Bavaria).
      The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
      Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
      processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
      for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant remains temporarily closed and all employees are in quarantine
      together with their household members. The first employees were discharged from quarantine 14 days
      after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 hours after resolution of symptoms.
      In the district of Dingolfing-Landau, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among residents and staff in a shared
      accommodation for asylum seekers.
      In the district of Germersheim, an increase in COVID-19 cases was observed in connection with a
      religious community.
      A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
      well as religious communities.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

7                                                                                                                     7
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.97 (95%-prediction interval: 0.80 – 1.16)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 06/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.89 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.80 – 0.97) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 06/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      In Mid-June, the estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) temporarily increased,
      but have since again decreased to a value of 1 or below. The marked increase was related to increased
      case numbers mainly due to local, outbreak-related COVID-19 transmission with the outbreak in North
      Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role (see section “Outbreaks”, above). The outbreak
      dynamics are also influenced in part by serial tests performed among possibly exposed persons, which
      led to the rapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases in some of the outbreak
      settings. Since the case numbers in Germany are at a low level overall, local outbreaks have a relatively
      strong influence on the value of the reproduction number. For this reason, the reproduction numbers
      may continue to fluctuate markedly.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 06/07/2020, a total of 1,260 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,263
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,238 (63%) are occupied, and 12,025 beds (37%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
       differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
       discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
       German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
