    Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among notified cases, 4,271 were children
    under 10 years of age (2.3%), 8,730 children and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (4.7%), 81,674 persons
    aged 20 to 49 years (43%), 57,884 persons aged 50 to 69 years (31%), 29,801 persons aged 70 to 89
    years (16%) and 5,305 persons aged 90 years and older (2.8%). The age is unknown in 99 notified cases.
    The mean age of cases is 49 years (median age 49 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons
    aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (18/06/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 160,996 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 4,886 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 2,771 of 18,601 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 28,642 (18%) of 162,532 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 174,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 26% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    So far, 13,602 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

   COVID-19 Situation Report 18/06/2020

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence was observed in three districts, primarily due to localised outbreaks: The districts
    of, Greiz (Thuringia), Guetersloh (North-Rhine-Westphalia), Verden (Lower Saxony) and Magdeburg
    (Saxony-Anhalt).
    A local COVID-19 outbreak among harvest workers in the district of Aichach-Friedberg had led to a sharp
    increase in the 7-day incidence.The applied measures (isolation, hygiene as well as identification and
    testing of contact persons), which were initiated immediately, as well as the early termination of the
    seasional harvest work, have led to a containment of the outbreak. The 7-day incidence has fallen
    considerably.
    The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Gütersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
    plant. Several hundred employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Contact tracing is ensured at the
    present time. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are being
    quarantined. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the district will be closed from 18.06. until
    the end of the summer holidays (11.08.2020). Such outbreaks have also occurred in other federal states,
    some of which have led to production closures.
    In Magdeburg, an outbreak affecting several now closed schools has led to an increase in the 7-day
    incidence.
    Once again there were major outbreaks in retirement- and nursing homes. In the districts of Greiz and
    Verden residents and nursing staff have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Further outbreaks were reported among members of religious communities, eg. from Berlin, Hesse and
    and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.

      Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for

      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 18/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 14/06/2020).
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day-R-value is 0.86 (95%-prediction interval: 0.68 – 1.06)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 18/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.00 (95%-prediction
      interval: 0.90– 1.10) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 18/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

      DIVI intensive care register
           A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
           RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
           well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
           (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
           number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
           hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
           As of 18/06/2020, a total of 1,271 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 31,637
           intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,705 (65%) are occupied, and 10,932 beds (35%) are
           currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

           *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
           differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
           discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
      Information from additional RKI-based surveillance
systems for acute respiratory illnesses
           GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
           (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 24, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased
           slightly. Since the end of the influenza epidemic in week 12, 2020, the ARI rate has been markedly lower
           than in previous seasons at this time of the year. Further information can be found under
           https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
           The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
           practices. In week 24, 2020, the number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections remained
           stable at a very low level. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 8 of 36
           samples (22%) in week 24, 2020. Since week 15, 2020, no influenza activity has been observed within
           the viral surveillance of the AGI. No SARS-COV-2 has been detected since week 16, 2020. Further
           information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
           A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
           patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
           the lower respiratory tract). In week 23, 2020, the total number of SARI cases decreased further to an
           unusually low level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 23, 2020, 6% were diagnosed with COVID-19
           (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (see Figure 5). Please note that only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the
           main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

    Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
        of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
        at short notice based on new insights.
        Infection risk
        The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
        behaviour.
        Disease severity
        In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
        increasing age and underlying illnesses.
        Burden on health system
        The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
        capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
        burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
