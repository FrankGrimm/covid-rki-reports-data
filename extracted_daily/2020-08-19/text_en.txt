COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 19/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly in many federal states and the
             number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased
             considerably. This trend is very concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus remains at an increased level. A total of only 15 districts transmitted zero cases over the
             past 7 days. In further 152 districts the 7-day-incidence is equal or below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In North Rhine Westphalia, Berlin and Hesse the 7-day incidences are markedly, in Bavaria and
             Rhineland - Palatinate slightly above the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 226,914 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,243 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities,
             meat-processing plants, agricultural and other occupational settings, as well as in the context of
             events with family and friends, religious events and travel.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 19/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. It is noticeable that the average age of infection has decreased over the past few
      weeks, that the incidence particularly in younger age groups has increased and is much higher than in
      older age groups.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many small outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger events with family and friends. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases
      are being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and increasing in dynamic. A further worsening of the situation must be avoided. On
      the one hand, the increase in younger age groups needs to be stopped, on the other hand, transmission
      into older and vulnerable groups needs to be prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises
      among elderly people, hospitalisations and number of deaths will likely rise as well. This can only be
      prevented if the entire population continues to be committed to decreasing transmission, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also outdoors -, by airing indoor areas
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community or face mask correctly. Large gatherings – especially
      indoors – should be avoided, and events with family and friends should be limited to close family
      members and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 226,914
      (+1,510) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 15 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past
      few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
      decreased continuously; on 12/07/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to
      125 districts.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 75,083 cases (33%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (19/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 7,516 were children under 10 years of age (3.3%), 13,713 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.1%), 103,296 persons aged 20 to 49 years (46%), 64,560 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (29%), 31,684 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,532 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.4%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 613 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 46 years
  (median age 47 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 190,136 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (46%), fever (39%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was

  reported in 5,374 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 6,917 of 45,828 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 31.713 (16%) of 196,645 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 203,900 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,243 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.1% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,120 (55%) are men and 4,119 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,903 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in
  meat processing plants.

    Outbreaks
    Twelve districts reported an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants. The federal
    states mainly affected are North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Bavaria. The increased incidence in the
    affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad.
    The high incidence in the district of Dingolfing-Landau, caused by an outbreak on an agricultural farm
    with an attached canning factory is decresasing.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for
    asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-processing plants and other occupational
    settings as well as in the context of family events and religious gatherings.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.
                                                                    Cases:               Symptom onset reported

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 19/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 15/08/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.03 (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 – 1.27) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 19/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.08 (95% prediction
     interval: 0.98 – 1.23) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 19/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. According to current
     observations, this seems to be associated to a great extent with an increasing number of cases among
     travel returnees, a larger number of smaller outbreaks and the overall case numbers in Germany, which
     have increased steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of disease control measures.

     R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 19/08/2020, a total of 1,284 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
     30,625 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,888 (71%) are occupied, and 8,737 (28%) are
     currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number

     increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
     well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
     data are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test
     laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-
     2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and
     via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 33/2020, 10,197,366 laboratory
     tests have been recorded to date, 264,990 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
     Up to and including week 33, 250 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
     one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis.
     Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
     the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
     the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
     (see Table 5).

       Testing of travellers at German points of entry
       At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres have been
       established. Some of the laboratories (covering Hannover, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Berlin-Tegel, Berlin-Schönefeld,
       Leipzig/Halle airports; Munich, Nuremberg train stations; Passau, Traunstein, Rosenheim motorway service
       stations) have voluntarily provided service statistics for the period 09.08 – 15.08.2020 to RKI. In total, 79,392 tests
       were reported from these entry points, of which 1,236 were positiv (1.56%). At the airports, out of 43,810 persons
       tested, 478 had a positive result (1.09%); at the motorway stations, out of 32,011 persons tested, 709 had a
       positive result (2.21%); at the two train stations, out of 3,571 persons tested, 49 had a positive result (1.37%). It is
       not possible to say to which extent these 79,392 tests are included in those reported in Table 5.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with a clear
       acceleration in recent weeks. At the same time, the number of districts that have not reported any cases
       in the last 7 days is decreasing. There are larger and smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in
       connection with celebrations in the circle of family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees,
       especially in the younger age groups, also contribute to the increase in the number of cases. Vaccines
       and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of
       the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
       play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
       indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
       is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
       maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
       risk of transmission outdoors.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
       individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
       previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
       Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
       care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
       large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
       system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
