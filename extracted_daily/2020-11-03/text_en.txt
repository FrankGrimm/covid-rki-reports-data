COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 03/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire
     population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 124.2 cases per 100,000 population.
  • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
     incidence of people ≥ 60 years has further increased to currently 81.3 cases/100.000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland is higher than the national
     total 7-day incidence.
  • The number of districts with an increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants continues to rise. Only 7
     districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of today, 137 districts have an incidence of >50-100
     cases/100,000 population, 228 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 32 districts have
     an incidence of >200 cases/100,000 population.
  • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
     gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in educational settings, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in
     occupational settings or related to religious events.
  • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has almost tripled in the past 2 weeks from 879 patients on
     20/10/2020 to 2.388 patients on 03/11/2020.
  • In total, 560,379 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,661 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
     to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 03/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values have been stable
      since the beginning of October, well above 1. Over the past few days the R-values have decreased and
      today are approximately 1. This means that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will infect on average
      one other person. As the number of infected persons is currently high in Germany, this means that the
      daily number of newly infected persons will remain high.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 560,379
  (+15,352) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  ** Mecklenburg – Western Pomerania did not report any data due to technical issues. These have since been resolved and will
  be available as usual from tomorrow on.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 272,202 cases (49%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

   The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
   group and reporting week in Figure 2 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
   the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
   proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
   from reporting week 17 to reporting week 25, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
   cases. This development continued in the following weeks. By comparison, the proportion of cases in the
   younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
   decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
   a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations. Absolute case numbers increased from week 29. Since
   reporting week 36, however, case numbers have increased again, with an ongoing increase in the
   proportion of cases among older age groups.

  Figure 3: Presentation of the notified COVID-19 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants in Germany by age group and reporting week
  (03/11/2020, 12 AM)
  Figure 3 shows that at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, COVID-19 incidence increased initially
  among 15-34-year-olds and 35-59-year-olds, followed by older persons over 80 years of age. After the
  decline in incidence for all age groups, the highest incidence since the renewed increase in case numbers
  is currently seen in the age group of 15 to 34-year-olds, followed by the age group of the 35-59-year-
  olds. From week 36, the incidence among persons 60 years of age and older has also been continually
  been increasing, and from week 40 onwards, an increase can be observed for all age groups. The
  increasing incidence among 60- to 79-year-olds and over 80-year-olds is very worrisome, since these
  persons have a higher risk of severe disease and death and require intensive care treatment more often
  than younger persons.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 382,157 (68%) of the notified cases. Among these, cough
  (41%), fever (32%), rhinorrhoea (23%) and sore throat (21%) were reported most and 15% had no or no
  relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Pneumonia was reported in 6,847 cases (1,8%). Since calendar week 17,
  cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and
  anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in 47,238
  of 237,538 cases (17%) with information available.
  Hospitalisation was reported for 45,116 (11%) of 420,592 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 371,500 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

   Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The proportion of deaths
   among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it decreased markedly until
   week 34 and has remained well under 1% since then. The proportion of cases reported with no or no
   symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until week 34 to 35%, but decreased since then to
   below 20% after week 38.

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to week of death are shown in Figure 4. The number of deaths has
  been increasing since week 37; markedly since week 42.
  Of all deaths, 9,110 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 12% of all cases were in this age
  group (Table 3). Thus far, 6 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to
  the RKI*. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for two of them. The number of deaths may
  change upon completion of data validation.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 48% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.

   In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
   place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of

  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad increased significantly after the
  opening of borders in calendar week 25, but has been declining again since week 35 (see Figure 5).
  Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be
  greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and hygiene and
  avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
  immediately. In addition, travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
  maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (405 of 412), including 228 urban and rural districts with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population and 137 districts with a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The
  dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  Only about a quarter of the total number of reported COVID-19 cases can be attributed to a specific
  outbreak. At the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, in weeks 13-18, many COVID-19 cases were
  assigned to nursing homes as well as hospitals and refugee homes, In weeks 23-32, the workplace was
  often given as the probable infection environment. Since the summer (from week 33 on), the number of
  outbreaks in private households has represented the largest share of outbreak situations besides the
  workplace and leisure activities. Recently, the number of cases in old people's homes and nursing homes
  also increased again.

     In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in the context of celebrations
     with family and friends. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large
     increases in the affected districts. However, many small outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in
     hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, and community facilities, kindergartens and
     schools, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to
     the increase of incidence.
     Further details regarding the ascertainment of outbreaks can be found (in German) in the
     Epidemiologisches Bulletin 38/2020
     (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/Ausgaben/38_20.pdf).
     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 7) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.

     Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
     less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 03/11/2020, a total of 1,283 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,720
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,482 (75%) are occupied, and 7,238 (25%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown inTable 6.

     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     epidemiologic situation on 26/10/2020. The current version can be found here:
