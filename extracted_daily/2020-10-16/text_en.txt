COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 15/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore,
     the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 37.2 cases per 100,000 population.
 • In comparison, the 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in Hesse, North Rhine-
     Westphalia and Saarland moderately higher and in Baden-Wuerttemberg slightly higher than the national
     mean 7-day incidence.
 • The Berlin districts Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Mitte, Neukoelln and Tempelhof-Schoeneberg as well as the
     districts Delmenhorst, Kassel, Berchtesgadener Land, Bitburg-Pruem and Sankt Wendel exceeded a 7-day
     incidence of 100 cases/100,000 population. The 7-day incidence was 50 to 100 cases/100,000 population in 62
     districts, in 132 additional districts it was 25-50 cases/100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again.
 • A number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are being
     reported particularly in the context of family events, and in nursing homes.
 • In total, 348,557 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,734 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
     electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
 • The National Testing Strategy was updated and includes targeted antigen testing and extension of testing to
     further population groups.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently a fast increase in nearly all federal states. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in the
      older age groups is currently slightly increasing. Since the end of September, R-values remained above 1.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      nursing homes.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. However, it is
      regarded as implausible that the virus has become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths
      can be explained as follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young
      people, who rarely experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader
      testing, which means more milder cases are identified. As elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly
      infected with SARS-CoV-2, hospitalisations and deaths are increasing. Severe cases and deaths can
      mainly be prevented through decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.
      The National Testing Strategy was updated on the basis of an ordinance on testing for SARS-CoV-2 which
      will enter into force on 15 October 2020. The overall objective of the National Testing Strategy remains
      the care for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the protection of vulnerable groups and the prevention of the
      spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The update includes the targeted use of antigen testing and the
      extension of testing to more population groups.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 348,557
  (+7,334) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 139,577 cases (40%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (16/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
   missing in 31% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
   reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
   above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
   facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 203 districts,
  including 4 city districts in Berlin (Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Mitte, Neukoelln und Tempelhof-
  Schoeneberg) and the districts of Delmenhorst (Lower Saxony), Kassel (Hesse), Berchtesgadener Land
  (Bavaria), Bitburg-Pruem (Rhineland-Palatinate) and Sankt Wendel (Saarland) with an incidence of over
  100 cases/100,000 population and 62 additional districts with a 7-day incidences of >50 cases/100,000
  population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  Currently, in most districts it is mostly a diffuse situation with increased frequency of COVID-10 cases in
  connection with private celebrations with family and friends. In several affected districts larger
  outbreaks are the cause of the sharp increase in case numbers. However, many smaller outbreaks in
  nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, schools and
  kindergarten, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events, continue to
  contribute to the increase in incidence.
  The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin is due to more diffuse transmission. Stricter distancing
  rules and opening restrictions for restaurants, bars and shops are applied since 10/10/2020.
  In the district of Bitburg-Pruem, too, private birthday parties have contributed significantly to the spread
  of the infections.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)

      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
      extracted from the notification system.
                             4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value

            (95%-prediction interval: 0.92 – 1.52)                               (95%-prediction interval: 1.12 – 1.49)
      Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
      less affected because every day of the week is used to determine the value.
      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 16/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 12/10/2020).
      Since the end of September, an increase of the R-values, which are above one, can be observed.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
      As of 16/10/2020, a total of 1,282 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,203
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,546 (71%) are occupied, and 8,657 (29%) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
 Mortality Monitoring
     A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
     excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
     the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
     (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data
     have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
     monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
     An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
     April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also among
     those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
     Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. All-cause mortality for the countries in the EuroMOMO network
     has now largely returned to expected levels even if in some countries there seems to be a small excess
     mortality.
     Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with a
     certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
     https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
     Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
     Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
     of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
     significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
     of May. In the first weeks of September, the number of deaths surpassed slightly the average of the
     previous years. In calendar week 38, 2020 (14/09 – 20/09/2020), 17,107 people deceased (+312
     compared to week 37).
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     epidemiologic situation on 07/10/2020. The current version can be found here:
