Summary (as of 20/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    In total, 141,672 COVID-19 cases and 4,404 deaths due to COVID-19 have been

     Wuerttemberg (255), Saarland (234) and Hamburg (227).
    Most cases (67%) are between 15 and 59 years old; men (48%) and women (52%) are
     almost equally affected.
    86% of deaths, but only 18% of all cases, occurred in persons aged 70 years or older.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 141,672 (+1,775) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 4,404 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and https://corona.rki.de.

    Germany by county and federal state (20/04/2020, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 51,025 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 48% are male and 52% are female. Among notified cases, 1,134 were children under 5
    years of age (1%), 2,817 children aged 5 to 14 years (2%), 95,336 persons aged 15 to 59 years (67%),
    27,268 persons aged 60 to 79 years (19%) and 14,918 persons aged 80 years and older (11%) (see Figure
    3). The age of 199 notified cases is unknown. The median age of cases is 50 years.

    information available (20/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 111,273 (79%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (50%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 2,884 cases (3%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 18,361 (17%) of 110,870 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 91,500 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. As the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    The 4,404 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 2,559 (58%) men and 1,842 (42%)
    women (sex was unknown in 3 cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 3,804 (86%) were in
    persons 70 years or older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. COVID-19 related outbreaks
    continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals. In some of these outbreaks, the number of
    deaths is relatively high.

    Occupation, accomodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Infection Against Protection Law (IfSG), information on occupation, accomodation
    or care in a facility relevant for infection control (see Table 3) is documented and electronically
    transmitted to RKI for notified COVID-19 cases.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    Thus far, 7,413 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG (Table 3). Among the cases reportedly working in medical facilities,
    72% were female and 28% male. The median age was 42 years. Hospitalisation was reported for 305 of
    6,940 cases among staff working in medical facilities with information available (4%). There were 13
    COVID-19 related deaths among staff working in medical facilities.The proportion of cases reported as
    working in medical facilities among all cases increased over time from at least 3.5% in Week 12, 4.7% in
    Week 13, 5.4% in Week 14, 6.6% in Week 15 to 6.5% in Week 16, 2020. Due to missing data on
    occupation over 40% of cases, the true proportion of cases working in medical facilities may be higher.
    Table 3 summarizes COVID-19 cases among persons cared for or working in a number of other facilities.
    The high case numbers among persons cared for or working in various care facilities are in keeping with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases attending or
    working in facilities concerned with child care or education reflects the low infection risk in children as
    well as school and day care closures during recent weeks. Cases among workers involved in food
    production or catering are comparatively infrequent.
    The proportion of persons with COVID-19 reported as working in the above facilities who actually
    acquired their infection in these settings is unknown.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R can only be estimated
    and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R= 0.9 (95% confidence
    interval: 0.8-1.1) and is based on current electronically notified cases (20/04/2020, 12:00 A.M.) and an
    assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were
    excluded from the estimation as their low number due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable

      DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document the capacities for intensive
      care as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals. The DIVI intensive care
      register documents the number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis.
      Since 16/04/2020, reporting is compulsory for all hospital sites with intensive care beds.
      As of 20/04/2020, a total of 1,159 hospitals or departments reported to DIVI to the registry. Overall,
      29,215 intensive care beds were registered, of which 16,955 (58%) are occupied and 12,260 beds are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals are shown in Table 3.
      Table 3: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (20/04/2020, 9:15 AM). Migration of the
      registry to a new server led to temporary reporting delays, thus comparisons with data prior to 03/04/2020 are not meaningful.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    International risk areas
      As of 10/04/2020 countries and regions are not longer classified as international risk areas. Due to
      pandemic spread, there is a global risk of acquiring COVID-19. Outbreaks are ongoing in a considerable
      number of countries, often with high numbers of cases; in other countries, the exact numbers of cases is
      unknown. Therefore there is a risk of transmission in Germany as well as in many other, not always well-
      defined regions worldwide.
