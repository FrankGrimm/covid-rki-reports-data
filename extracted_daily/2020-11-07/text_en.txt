 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 07/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
     strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 133.3 cases per 100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
     incidence of people ≥ 60 years has further increased to currently 89.9 cases/100.000 population.
 • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland is higher than the national
     total 7-day incidence.
 • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 7 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
     today, 39 districts have an incidence of >25-50 cases /100,000 population, 117 districts have an incidence of >50-100
     cases/100,000 population, 249 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 15 districts have
     an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
 • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
     gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as
     in occupational settings or related to religious events.
 • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has almost tripled in the past 2 weeks from 1,203 patients on
     24/10/2020 to 2,839 patients on 07/11/2020.
 • In total, 642,488 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11,226 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
     to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 06/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has decreased and is 1 today.
      This means that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will infect on average one other person. As the
      number of infected persons is currently high in Germany, this means that the daily number of newly
      infected persons will remain high.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 323,997 cases (50%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (07/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  Due to technical problems, case numbers among people cared for or employed in facilities according to
  §§ 23, 33, 36 and 42 Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG) cannot be shown this
  weekend.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (405 of 412). By now, 249 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 15 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  117 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population and 39 districts have a 7-day
  incidence of > 25 – 50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse most of the times, with several cases clustering in the context
  of celebrations with family and friends, but increasingly as well in community facilities and retirement
  and nursing homes. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the affected districts. At the same time, many small outbreaks in hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers
  and refugees, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to
  contribute to the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
  extracted from the notification system.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
    less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

    The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past days the R-value has
    decreased slightly and is 1 today.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
    collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
    well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
    16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
    (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
    As of 07/11/2020, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,345
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,256 (75%) are occupied, and 7,089 (25%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
      reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
      in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
