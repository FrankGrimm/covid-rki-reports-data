COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 22/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore,
     the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 56.2 cases per 100,000 population.
 • The 7-day incidence is considerably higher in Berlin, Bremen, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, and
     moderately higher in Bavaria and Saarland than the national average 7-day incidence.
 • The number of districts with an increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants continues to rise,
     to 316 urban and rural districts. Of these, 34 districts have an incidence of > 100 cases/100,000 population and
     132 districts have an incidence of > 50-100 cases/100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again (ref.
     Daily Situation Report of 20.10.2020).
 • A number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are being
     reported particularly in the context of family events, and in nursing homes.
 • In total, 392,049 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,905 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
     transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 22/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in nearly all federal states. The
      proportion of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently increasing. Since the start of October,
      R-values have been clearly above 1.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Since end July, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below 1% and is
      thus markedly lower than in the spring, particularly in April (ref. Daily Situation Report of 20 Oct 2020).
      However, it is regarded as implausible that the virus has become less pathogenic. Rather, the low
      proportion of deaths can be explained as follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred
      mainly among young people, who most of the time experience a less severe course of disease. On the
      other hand there is also broader testing, which means more milder cases are identified.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.
      The National Testing Strategy was updated on the basis of an ordinance on testing for SARS-CoV-2 which
      has entered into force on 15 October 2020. The overall objective of the National Testing Strategy
      remains the care for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the protection of vulnerable groups and the
      prevention of the spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The update includes the targeted use of antigen
      testing and the extension of testing to more population groups.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 392,049
  (+11,287) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 165,329 cases (42%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (22/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases.
   Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 37% of cases;
   the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
   considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
   the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  *for care according to § 33 IfSG only cases under 18 years of age are taken into account, as other information may be assumed to be incorrect.
  Due to changes in data registration, not all data entries for cases ascertained in the most recent version of the surveillance software could be
  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 316 districts,
  including 34 urban and rural districts with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 132
  districts with a 7-day incidences of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with occasional clustering in the context of celebrations with
  family and friends. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the concerned districts. However, many small outbreaks in old people’s and nursing homes, in
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, and community facilities, kindergartens and
  schools, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to
  the increase of incidence.
  The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district of Vechta is largely due to new infections in connection
  with a private funeral. Other infections have occurred at private gatherings and among contacts at the
  workplace.
  In the district Erzgebirgskreis, COVID-19 cases have occurred in more than 10 inpatient care facilities.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
  extracted from the notification system.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
       As of 22/10/2020, a total of 1,283 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 29,657
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,473 (72%) are occupied, and 8,184 (28%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
       Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
      systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 42, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased.
     Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 42, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections
     remained stable. The number of patients visits due to ARI decreased in children aged 5 to 14 years, but
     remained stable in all other age groups. Overall, it remained at a similar level to that of previous seasons
     at this time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 12 of 15
     sentinel samples (80%) in week 42, 2020, whereas SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in none of the
     analyzed samples. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 41, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable compared
     to week 40. Of all reported SARI cases in week 41, 2020, 11% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10
     code U07.1!) (See Figure 3). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code
     for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this
     analysis.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    Data on emergency department utilisation
       In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
       the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
       https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
       As of 21 October 2020, data from 8 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between 1
       November 2019 and 1 March 2020, an average of 5,691 emergency department admissions per week
       was recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 42% decrease in the number of admissions
       was observed, to 3,307 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable
       surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions,
       public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase in
       admissions has been observed. In week 42 2020, 4.841 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the
       number of admissions is currently 15% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see
       Figure 4).
       In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
       the RKI analyses emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
       https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
       Within the emergency department situation report of the 21 October 2020, data from 8 emergency
       departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 18 October 2020. In week 42
       2020, 4,841 admissions were recorded, a -3.8% change compared to last week, and a -15.0% average
       change compared to the mean of last year (Figure 4).
