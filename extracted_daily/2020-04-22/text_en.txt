    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 48% are male and 52% are female. Among notified cases, 2,362 were children under 10
    years of age (2%), 5,991 children and youth aged 10 to 19 years (4%), 62,450 persons aged 20 to 49 years
    (43%), 47,742 persons aged 50 to 69 years (33%) 23,069 persons aged 70 to 89 years (16%) and 3,886
    persons aged 90 years and older (3%). The age of 193 notified cases is unknown. The middle age of cases
    is 50 years (median 50 years). The highest incidences are in the age groups above 90 years (see Figure 3),
    with only 2.7% of reported cases.

    information available (22/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 115,384 (79%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (50%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 3,028 cases (3%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 19,335 (17%) of 114,992 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 99,400 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. As the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    The 4,879 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 2,802 (57%) men and 2,074 (43%)
    women (sex was unknown in 3 cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 4,220 (87%) were in
    persons 70 years or older, but only 19% of all cases were in this age group. COVID-19 related outbreaks
    continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals. In some of these outbreaks, the number of
    deaths is relatively high.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    Thus far, 7,862 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG (Table 3). Among the cases reportedly working in medical facilities,
    72% were female and 28% male. The median age was 41 years. Hospitalisation was reported for 333 of
    7,365 cases among staff working in medical facilities with information available (4,5%). There were 18
    COVID-19 related deaths among staff working in medical facilities.The proportion of cases reported as
    working in medical facilities among all cases increased over time from at least 3.6% in Week 12, 4.8% in
    Week 13, 5.5% in Week 14, 6.8% in Week 15, to 7.0% in Week 16, 2020. Due to missing data on
    occupation over 40% of cases, the true proportion of cases working in medical facilities may be higher.
    Table 3 summarizes COVID-19 cases among persons cared for or working in a number of other facilities.
    The high case numbers among persons cared for or working in various care facilities are in keeping with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases attending or
    working in facilities concerned with child care or education reflects that children are not as affected and
    that schools have been closed during recent weeks.
    The proportion of persons with COVID-19 reported as working in the above facilities who actually
    acquired their infection in these settings is unknown.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R can only be estimated
    and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R= 0.9 (95% confidence
    interval: 0.7-1.0) and is based on current electronically notified cases (22/04/2020, 12:00 A.M.) and an
    assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were

    estimate. For more details on the methodology see Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 (in German)

    DIVI intensive care register
    A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
    RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document the capacities for intensive
    care as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals. The DIVI intensive care
    register documents the number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis.
    Since 16/04/2020, reporting is compulsory for all hospital sites with intensive care beds.
    As of 22/04/2020, a total of 1,230 hospitals or departments reported to DIVI to the registry. Overall,
    31,885 intensive care beds were registered, of which 19,199 (60%) are occupied, and 12,686 beds (40%)
    are currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals are shown in
    Table 4.
    Table 4: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (22/04/2020, 9:15 AM). Migration of the
    registry to a new server led to temporary reporting delays, thus comparisons with data prior to 03/04/2020 are not meaningful.

    Laboratory tests
    Data on SARS-CoV-2 test numbers from university hospitals, research institutions as well as clinical and
    outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are collected and merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    transmitted via an internet-based survey of the RKI via Voxco (RKI test laboratory query), by the network
    for respiratory viruses (RespVir), the antibiotic resistance surveillance established at the RKI or via an
    internal query of a laboratory network.
    A total of at least 2,072,669 tested samples have been reported until week 16/2020. Among these,
    155,773 samples (7,5%) have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

      Sum                            2,072,669                  155,773
      In addition to the number of tests carried out, information on daily test capacity is queried. In week 16,
      126 laboratories reported a total capacity of 136,064 tests per day. 126 laboratories provided information
      on their working days per week, which ranged from 5 to 7 working days. Assuming a minimum of 5
      working days per week for laboratories without provided information on working days, a testing capacity
      of at least 818,426 feasible PCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (daily test capacity of the
      respective laboratory x working days, sum of all transmitting laboratories) can be derived. In week 16, 34
      laboratories reported a backlog of 2,258 samples to be processed. 50 laboratories reported delivery
      problems for reagents and, increasingly, for swabs.
      In addition to this aggregated weekly recording of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests, more detailed data on
      SARS-CoV-2 tests have been collected by the laboratories involved in Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
      (ARS) since 01/01/2020. As of 21/04/2020, 49,677 (8.4%) of 558.858 tests have tested positive for SARS-
      COV-2 in 52 laboratories.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    International risk areas
      As of 10/04/2020 countries and regions are not longer classified as international risk areas. Due to
      pandemic spread, there is a global risk of acquiring COVID-19. Outbreaks are ongoing in a considerable
      number of countries, often with high numbers of cases; in other countries, the exact numbers of cases is
      unknown. Therefore there is a risk of transmission in Germany as well as in many other, not always well-
      defined regions worldwide.
      All arriving travellers in Germany are to remain in quarantine for 14 days:

    Other measures
