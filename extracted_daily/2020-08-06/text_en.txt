COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 06/08/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    In the past few weeks, the number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
          has decreased markedly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal states. This
          trend is concerning.
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 5.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 65 districts transmitted zero
          cases over the past 7 days. In a further 228 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000
          inhabitants.
     •    In total, 213,067 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,175 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >390
          cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company and among employees of a canning
          company.
     •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
          nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, as well as in the context of
          religious or family events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 06/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      An increase in the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases occurred over the past 2 weeks in many of
      the federal states. After Covid-19 case numbers had decreased slightly at the beginning of the week due
      to the testing and reporting delay at the weekend, cases have increased again.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case outbreaks in different administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and
      health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning
      from travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing over the past two weeks. This
      development is very concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further
      worsening of the situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to
      be committed to decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and
      hygiene - also in outdoor settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community
      or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 213,067
      (+1,045) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 65 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days decreased
      continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  As part of quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices, corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports) can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 66,869 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 2.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (06/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51 are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data on
  age and gender were reported, 6,374 were children under 10 years of age (3.0%), 11,540 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.4%), 95,432 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 62,579 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (29%), 31,199 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,477 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.6%). The age and/or gender was unknown in 466 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 47
  years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 180,571 (85%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (47%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,297
  cases (3.0%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance

  category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two
  symptoms was reported in 5,469 of 36,443 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,955 (17%) of 185,351 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 195,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,175 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.3% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,077 (55%) are men and 4,093 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
  five cases.
  The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,841 (85%) were
  in people aged 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Thus far, three deaths
  among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical
  conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases. Since
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases, the
  proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Five districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts of
  Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, the city Offenbach in Hesse, the city Ingolstadt in Bavaria, the district of
  Odenwaldkreis in Hesse and the district Dueren in North Rhine-Westphalia.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to two outbreaks with >390 COVID-19-cases, one among harvest
  workers of an agricultural company and the other among employees of a canning company. The latter is
  based in two locations, all employees are currently being tested.Quarantine was ordered for all

    employees of both companies. The local population (3,300 inhabitants) has been offered voluntary
    testing. In the district of Offenburg the increase in case numbers is predominantly due to cases among
    returning travelers; this is also explains a number of cases in Herne.
    The cases reported from Ingoldstadt can be traced back to 2 outbreaks, 1 in a religious and 1 in a family/
    work setting. The tests among the contactsare being processed currently and thus it is likely that more
    cases will be reported in the upcoming days.
    In the district of Odenwaldkreis most of the cases can be traced back to one family, it should be noted
    though that there was no celebration or greater gathering reported.
    In the district of Dueren the higher numbers of cases are due on the one hand to returning travellers
    and on the other hand to a smaller number of cases among employees of an agricultural company.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

     outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
     affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
     relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
     The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.99 (95%-prediction interval: 0.80 – 1.26) and is based on
     electronically notified cases as of 05/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.06 (95% prediction
     interval: 0.95 – 1.20) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 05/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported 7-day R value has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a
     larger number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

     number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     As of 05/08/2020, a total of 1,274 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,527 intensive
     care beds were registered, of which 21,449 (70%) are occupied, and 9,078 (30%) are currently available. The

   Data on emergency department utilisation
       In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
       the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
       https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
       As of 02-08-2020, data from 10 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between 01-11-
       2019 and 01-03-2020, an average of 6,608 emergency department admissions per week was recorded.
       From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was observed,
       to 3,969 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable surveillance systems
       in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions, public measures were
       taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase in admissions has been
       observed. In week 31 2020, 6,381 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the number of admissions is
       currently 3% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see Figure 5).

  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
   systems for actue respiratory illnesses
       GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
       (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 31, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased.

   The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
   practices. In week 31, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
   decreased. The ARI incidence decreased for the age group 0 to 14 years and remained stable for the
   age group 60 years and older. Overall, it remained at a low level that matches the level of previous
   season at this time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 13 of
   24 sentinel samples (54%) in week 31, 2020. Since week 16, 2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected
   within the viral sentinel surveillance of the AGI. Further information can be found under
   https://influenza.rki.de/.
   A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
   patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
   the lower respiratory tract). In week 30, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable overall.
   Of all reported SARI cases in week 30, 2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!)
   (See Figure 6). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the
   main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks).
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
       care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
       large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
