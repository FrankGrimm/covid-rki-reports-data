  Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.

  The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 23/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to
      commit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.
  • The national 7-day incidence is 195 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is considerably above the national incidence.
  • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of people ≥60
      years is currently 197 cases/100,000 population.
  • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 356 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of
      these, 75 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 7 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
  • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and
      nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious events. For a large
      proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
  • Yesterday, 24,740 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 962 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted to
      the RKI in Germany. With 5,243 cases, the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.
  • RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general population as very high.
  • On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is
      unknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the new virus variant has not yet been detected in Germany.
  • RKI will not publish any daily situation report on December 24 and January 1, 2021. Testing and notification activities may be lower during the
      festive season, possibly resulting in an incomplete picture of the epidemiological situation in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 23/12/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well
      as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the rise in cases could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since 04/12/2020 case numbers have been sharply increasing again.
      The R-value is currently around 1, with a slight tendency above 1 in the longer term and recently a slight
      downward trend. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects a little more
      than another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a
      high number of new infections every day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly in
      households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and educational
      settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without
      traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, the 7-day incidence increases in all age groups, particularly in persons aged 80 years or over. As
      the latter more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is
      also increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of
      infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.
      Note: On 25/12/2020 and 01/01/2021 no Daily Situation Report will be published.
      Reported COVID-19 cases should be interpreted with care during the festive season as there may be fewer
      medical consultations, less sampling and diagnostic testing during that time. This may lead to fewer notified
      cases at the local level and hence to fewer transmitted COVID-19 cases to the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,554,920
  (+24,740) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 859,388 cases (55%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (23/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
  proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  Due to changes in the variables, no notifications according to §42 are listed here.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
  among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for nearly every district
  (411/412). There are 75 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 7 districts with an
  incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected
  districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                           7-day R-value
                                0.83                                                                   0.92
         (95%-Prädiktionsintervall: 0.69 – 0.98)                                      (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.83 – 0.99)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset electronically
  reported to RKI (orange) (as of 23/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 19/12/2020).
  Figure 3: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 23/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 19/12/2020).
  The R-value is currently around 1, with a slight tendency above 1 in the longer term and recently a slight
  downward trend. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects a little more
  than another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a
  high number of new infections every day.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
    with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
    number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
    with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
    As of 23/12/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,742
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,918 (82%) are occupied, and 4,824 (18%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
    patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
    cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
    clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey,
    via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance
    established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a
    professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 51/2020, 33,708,381 PCR-laboratory
    tests have been recorded to date, 1,612,012 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Up to and including week 51, 257 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in one of
    the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register and correct the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible
    that the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is
    not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
    (Table 4 with data for the last 10 weeks – complete data since beginning of testing are available at
    http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German)).
    As testing criteria were adapted to the current situation of limited testing capacities in face of high case
    numbers and to take into account the common cold season, from week 46 onwards the proportion of
    positive tests cannot be compared directly to former weeks (Adapted testing criteria:

  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for acute respiratory illnesses
      An ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients (ICD-
      10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
      respiratory tract). In week 50, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased slightly. Over half of the
      hospitalised SARI cases in 72 sentinel hospitals were diagnosed with COVID-19. The proportion of COVID-19
      infections among SARI cases increased slightly to 68% (s. Table 5).
      During the last weeks the number of hospitalised respiratory cases increased in cases above 60 years. The
      number of cases in the age group 35-59 years remained stable on a high level in week 50 (see Figure 4)
      Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis
      and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
       situation on 11/12/2020. The RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general population to be very
       high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as the
       occurrence of outbreaks especially in households. occupational settings and nursing and senior care homes.
       Therefore. more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
       is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
       substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
