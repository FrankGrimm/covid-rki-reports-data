COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 11/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal states and the number of
             districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased markedly. This trend is
             concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 6.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus further increased. A total of 46 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a
             further 215 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Nordrhein-Westfalia and Hamburg the 7-day incidences are high, with a markedly increasing
             trend. In Berlin and Hesse the 7-day incidences are also higher than the mean total 7-day
             incidence.
        •    In total, 217,293 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,201 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >400
             cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company and among employees of a canning
             company.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, meat-processing plants
             and other occupational settings, educational settings, among travellers and in the context of
             religious or family events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 11/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. The increase in cases in Hamburg is not soley due to the outbreak that was reported
      at a shipyard, but is also due to travellers.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many smaller outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in
      various settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, educational and occupational settings,
      but also in community and health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified
      among travellers entering Germany.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also in
      outdoor settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community or face mask
      correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 217,293
      (+966) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 46 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past
      few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
      decreased continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.

   Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
   transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
   onset of symptoms is unknown in 69,290 cases (32%), thus their date of reporting is provided in
   Figure 2.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (11/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Table 2 depicts the evolution of the sex
  distribution and average age over time. Among all notified cases for whom data on age and gender were
  reported, 6,739 were children under 10 years of age (3.1%), 12,200 children and teenagers aged 10 to
  19 years (5.6%), 97,699 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 63,276 persons aged 50 to 69 years (29%),
  31,353 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,498 persons aged 90 years and older (2.5%). The age
  and/or gender was unknown in 528 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 47 years (median age 47
  years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (11/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  The presentation of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 4 shows a continuous, distinct decrease in the relative proportion of
  people over 80 years of age from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a marked
  decrease in the number of cases, which also continued in the following weeks. In comparison, the
  proportion of cases in the younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same
  period, with a corresponding decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportion
  across all age groups entered a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations, while as of week 32 the
  proportion of the under 20 year olds has increased slightly. The absolute number of cases has been
  increasing since week 28.

   weeks 10 to 32 (11/08/2020, 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cases is depicted by the red line.
   Clinical aspects
   Information on symptoms is available for 183,607 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
   symptoms were cough (47%), fever (39%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,325
   cases (2.9%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance
   category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two
   symptoms was reported in 5,868 of 39,368 cases (15%).
   Hospitalisation was reported for 31,200 (17%) of 188,836 COVID-19 cases with information on
   hospitalisation status. The proportion of cases hospitalized has decreased over the course of the past
   few weeks.
   Approximately 198,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
   recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
   Table 2 depicts the proportion of hospitalization and deaths according to notification week.

  A total of 9,201 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.2% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,096 (55%) are men and 4,101 (45%) are women (see Table 3), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The proportion of deaths among cases was highest in reporting weeks 13 to 18, ranging from
  4.2% to 6.9%, and has decreased markedly since then (Table 2).
  The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,864 (85%) were
  in people aged 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Thus far, three deaths
  among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical
  conditions were reported for all three.

   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
   accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases. Since
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases, the
   proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
   considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
   the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
   care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.

  Countries of Exposure
  Of the 217,293 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
  71,969 (33%).
  Borders have been opening since reporting week 25, initially within Europe. Since then, the eproportion
  of COVID-19 cases for whom countries other than Germany were reported as the country of exposure
  has increased. This proportion peaked at 46% (2,975 cases) in reporting week 11, after which it rapidly
  decreased in association with the implemented travel restrictions to 0.4% (19 cases) in week 20. From
  week 21 onwards, this proportion has again increased to 31% (1,777 cases) in week 32.
  Table 5 lists the top 15 countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks
  29 to 32. The Western Balkan countries, as well as Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania were most frequently
  reported as the country of exposure.

  The proportion of cases with exposure outside of Germany has substantially increased during the past
  weeks. Through consistent prevention and early identification, transmission and subsequent cases can
  be considerably reduced. To this end, testing for travellers returning from abroad is being offered free-
  of-charge, with mandatory testing for travellers from high risk countries to be implemented later this
  week . It remains essential that people follow hygiene and distancing recommendations, avoid crowds
  and that all persons who develop COVID-19 compatible symptoms obtain testing immediately.
  Outbreaks
  Two districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria and the city of Duisburg.
  In the district of Dingolfing-Landau a 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
  was observed. The increase is due to two outbreaks with >400 COVID-19-cases, one among harvest
  workers of an agricultural company and the other one among employees in two of three locations of a
  canning company. On 09/08/2020 80 were still counted active cases. Quarantine was ordered for all
  employees of both companies. The local population (3,300 inhabitants) has been offered voluntary
  testing. No transmission into the local population has been detected thus far.

    In Duisburg cases among travellers entering Germany play an important role in the observed high 7-day
    incidence.
    In Hamburg >75 cases were reported amongst employees of a shipyard. Of these, about one third are
    residents of other federal states or of another country. Cases among travellers also contributed to the
    marked increase in the 7-day incidence.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    educational settings, meat-processing plants and other occupational settings, in the context of family
    events and religious communities as well as among travellers.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 11/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 07/08/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
   estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
   This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
   outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
   affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
   relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
   The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.97 (95%-prediction interval: 0.79 – 1.16) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 11/08/2020, 12:00 AM.

      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.04 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.94 – 1.14) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 11/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
      The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is associated with a
      larger number of small outbreaks, but also with case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
      steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures and due to an increased number of travel
      returnees.

   DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 11/08/2020, a total of 1,274 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
      30,390 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,562 (71%) are occupied, and 8,828 (28%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number
       of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or
       increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
       ** The high number of deceased as of today is due to the delayed entry of a reporting area which exhibits irregular reporting
       behaviour
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks).
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
       care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
       large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
       system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
