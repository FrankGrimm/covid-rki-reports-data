Quality checks and data cleaning by the local health departments and federal state health authorities can lead to corrections to cases previously
transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
    Figure 2 shows the course of the COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population transmitted to the RKI on the
    last 7 days in each of the federal states and in all of Germany. The values for the 7-day incidence in the
    federal states range from 521.9 per 100,000 population in Saxony to 89.4 per 100,000 population in
    Schleswig-Holstein.

      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting the daily updated R-value can be retrieved
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
      Annex:
      Notes on data collection and evaluation
      The data presented in this situation report represent a temporal snapshot. Information on individual
      cases can be obtained and added by the health authorities in the course of the disease. It is not possible
      to obtain complete data for all variables.
      If necessary, the local public health authorities collect additional information, evaluate reported cases
      and initiate the necessary infection control measures. In accordance with the Infection Protection Act,
      the data are transmitted electronically by the local public health authorities to the federal state health
      authority and from there to the RKI on the next working day at the latest. The data is updated at the RKI
      daily at 0:00 AM.
      Data entry and data transmission can lead to a time lag from the time the case is reported to the local
      public health authorities until publication by the RKI, so case numbers may deviate from those from
      other sources.
      For the calculation of the incidences, the data of the population statistics of the Federal Statistical Office
      from 31.12.2020 are used. The calculation of the 7-day incidence is based on the reporting date, i.e. the
      date on which the local public health authorities became aware of the case and recorded it
      electronically. For the 7-day incidence, the cases reported on the last 7 days are counted.

                                                                             COVID-19 situation report as of 11/11/2021 5
On the other hand, the number of cases since the previous day, as shown in the situation report and
dashboard, is tied to the date when the case is first published in the RKI's reporting. Thus, due to
transmission delays, it may occur that cases with a reporting date more than 7 days ago are still included
in the situation report. At the same time, the number of cases since the previous day also may contain
cases that were subsequently deleted in data quality checks. Thus, the 7-day incidence cannot be readily
calculated from these single-day incidences.
Notes
1    The number of cases since the previous day refers to the date of receipt at the RKI; due to the delay in
     transmission, cases from previous days may be included.
2    The number of active cases results from the number of transmitted cases minus the deaths and the estimated
     number of recovered cases.
3    The algorithm for estimating the number of people who have recovered assumes an average duration of
     illness from onset or hospitalization date on. The true length of symptomatic illness and/or sequelae are
     usually not available in the reporting system.
4    The proportion of COVID-19 occupancy in total number of operable beds only includes ICU for adults.
5    The total number of persons vaccinated at least once includes persons who received initial vaccinations with :
     Comirnaty® (BioNTech/Pfizer), Spikevax® (Moderna), Vaxzevria® (AstraZeneca) or vaccination with Janssen®
     (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine.
6    Fully vaccinated against COVID-19 means: two vaccine doses with Comirnaty® (BioNTech/Pfizer), Spikevax®
     (Moderna), Vaxzevria® (AstraZeneca) or one dose with Janssen® (Johnson & Johnson) or a single dose in the
     case of COVID-19 recovered patients.
