1 The difference to previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay of data transmission former cases may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 24/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
        strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The proportion of outbreaks with over 5 people within the settings of nursing homes has continuously and considerably
        increased since week 38.
    • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 142 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 112 cases/100,000 population.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony is higher than the national total
        7-day incidence.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 5 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000 population. In
        comparison, 283 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 29 districts have an incidence
        of >250 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households,
        but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to
        religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • Since mid of October, the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has strongly increased, from 655 patients
        on October 15th to 3.770 patients on 24/11/2020.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 24/11/2020
2
      • Until 24/11/2020, 13,554 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 249 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
          been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The increase has
      leveled off since the second week of November. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is
      currently increasing. In November, the reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1. This means
      that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of
      infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still a high number of new
      cases every day.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including households and in old people’s and nursing homes as well as in schools and
      occupational settings. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2,
      without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of incident cases among older people is on the rise again. As they more
      often have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing.
      These can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 942,687
  (+13,554) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *There were technical problems with the data transfer between Baden-Württemberg and the RKI. The missing cases will be
  reported tomorrow

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 503,737 cases (53%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (24/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Figure 2: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=804,791 cases with respective data in
  the weeks 10 to 47 (24/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and
  age-specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  The first wave of the pandemic in Germany started in week 11 with a high 7-day incidence in 20-59-year-
  olds followed by a rising incidence in the over-80 years old until week 15, which fell again until week 24,
  Since reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence has increased steadily starting in younger age-
  groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups. Among 20-29-year-olds, a slight decrease is
  seen from reporting week 47 upwards; while among the 30-69-year-olds, case numbers seem to have
  reached a high-level plateau. Among the over 80-year-olds there is a substantial increase in cases.

  The proportion of deaths among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it
  decreased markedly until week 34 and has remained well under 1% until week 43 where the proportion
  of deaths exceeded 1% again for the first time after a slightly increasing trend could be observed since
  week 39.
  The proportion of cases reported with no or no symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until
  week 34 to 35%, but decreased since then to below 20% after week 38.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 5). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  As of 18/11/2020, the number and proportion of persons ≥ 60 years old are reported in each category.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 24/11/2020

  Possible countries of exposure
  Of the 942,687 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
  430,476 (46%) cases.
  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
  place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0,4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of
  reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting a
  probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined
  again since then. The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the
  summer vacation period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week. Since then, it
  has decreased to currently 532 cases in week 47, and the proportion of all cases with corresponding
  information has decreased significantly to 0.4% in week 47.
  In weeks 44-47, 5,291 persons reported a possible site of infection abroad. The countries most
  frequently mentioned in the last four weeks for exposure abroad were Poland, Turkey and Kosovo.
  Overall, the trend is decreasing for all countries.
  Travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must maintain a 10-day quarantine
  unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (407 of 412). There are 29 districts in the group of the highest incidence of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in
  the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many small
  outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  and community facilities, kindergartens and schools, various occupational settings and in the context of
  religious gatherings continue to contribute to the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person,
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 4), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 5.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                                0.87                                                            0.90
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.73 – 0.99)                         (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.83 – 0.97)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

  Figure 5: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 24/11/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 20/11/2020).
  The reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1 in November. This means that, on average, each
  person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently
  very high in Germany, this means that there is still a high number of new cases every day.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

   DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
       As of 24/11/2020, a total of 1,288 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,882
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,925 (79%) are occupied, and 5,957 (21%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.
       Table 6: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (22/11/2020, 12:15 PM).

       *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
       patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
       cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of the recent increase in case numbers with severe disease, which have to be treated in ICUs and
       the increasingly tense situation in the health system the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
       situation on 11/11/2020, The current version can be found here:
