  The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.
2
  Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3
  The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 22/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to
      commit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.
  • Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 198 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony
      and Thuringia, it is considerably above the national incidence.
  • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of people ≥60
      years is currently 196 cases/100,000 population.
  • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. No district had an incidence of ≤25 cases/100,000 population. In
      comparison, 364 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 72 districts have an incidence of >250-500
      cases/100,000 population and 9 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
  • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and
      nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious events. For a large
      proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
  • Yesterday, 19,528 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 731 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted to
      the RKI in Germany. With 5,216 cases, the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.
  • RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general population as very high.
  • The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) published recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccination (17/12/2020).
  • On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is
      unknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the new virus variant has not yet been detected in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 22/12/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well
      as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the rise in cases could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since 04/12/2020 case numbers have been sharply increasing again.
      The R-value is currently around 1, with a slight tendency above 1. This means that, on average, each person
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects a little more than another person. As the number of infected persons is
      currently very high in Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly in
      households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and educational
      settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without
      traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, the 7-day incidence increases in all age groups, particularly in persons aged 80 years or over. As
      the latter more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is
      also increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of
      infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,530,180
  (+19,528) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 846,725 cases (55%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (22/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Figure 2: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=1,517,901 cases with respective data in
  the weeks 10 to 51 (22/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  The first wave of the pandemic in Germany started in week 11 with a high 7-day incidence in 20-59-year-
  olds followed by a rising incidence in the over-80 years old until week 15, which fell again until week 24,
  Since reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence has increased steadily starting in younger age-
  groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups. Currently, an increase of the 7-day incidence
  can be seen in all age groups, especially in the age groups 80 years and older.

  Figure 3 displays the percentages of deceased, hospitalized and cases with COVID-19 relevant symptoms.
  The percentage of deaths among cases was less than 1% between week 30 and 41. An increasing trend is
  visible from week 36 onwards. As deaths occur on average only 2-3 weeks after infection, further reports of
  deaths among currently reported cases are expected for weeks 48-51. The proportion of hospitalized
  COVID-19 cases stabilized at 6 to 9% since week 37. The percentage of cases with COVID-19 relevant
  symptoms increased from 79% in week 37 to 86% in week 49. These percentages may equally change due
  to delayed reporting and data corrections. During the summer (weeks 26-36) these proportions were lower

  asymptomatic infections were detected more frequently. The data on which the figure is based and that
  were published here on previous Tuesdays can be found at: www.rki.de/covid-19-tabelle-klinische-aspekte
  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 deaths according to week of death for the reporting weeks 10 - 50 (22/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  The figures on the first page show the number of deaths reported daily according to date of entry at RKI. This
  may also include cases with a date of death several days in the past. Figure 4 shows the reported COVID-19
  deaths by calendar week according to the date of death. For recent weeks, further reports of deaths among
  reported cases can be expected.
  A significant increase in the number of deaths was observed since week 37. Of all deaths, 23.740 (88%) were
  among people aged 70 years or older, with a median age of 83 years, while this age group accounts for only
  14% of all cases (Table 3). Thus far, 17 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI. Child deaths are still being validated.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
  proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  Due to changes in the variables, no notifications according to §42 are listed here.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
  among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Possible countries of exposure
  In weeks 47 to 51, of the 707,193 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure
  was missing in 370,543 (52%) cases. In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that
  had a possible foreign country as place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0,4% in reporting week 19 as a
  result of travel restrictions.
  As of reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting
  a probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined again
  since then. The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the summer
  vacation period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week. Since then, it has decreased
  to currently 307 cases in week 51. The proportion of all cases with a reported foreign place of exposure has
  decreased significantly to > 1% in week 51. In weeks 47-51, 2,570 persons reported a possible site of
  infection abroad.

    COVID-19 Situation Report 22/12/2020

    Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
    quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (for further details
    see https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende).
    Outbreaks
    An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for nearly every district
    (412/412). There are 72 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 9 districts with an
    incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected
    districts.
    In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
    particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
    hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
    schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
    estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that shows
    the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
    days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
    R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
    and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
    week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
    events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
    course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                                        4-day R-value                                                                        7-day R-value
                                             0.93                                                                                 0.95
                             (95%-Prädiktionsintervall: 0.80 – 1.09)                                             (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.87 – 1.06)
    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
    affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
                                                                                   Cases:                         Symptom onset reported

    Figure 6: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 22/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 18/12/2020).
    The R-value is currently around 1, with a slight tendency above 1. This means that, on average, each person
    infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects a little more than another person. As the number of infected persons is
    currently very high in Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
    with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
    number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
    with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
    As of 22/12/2020, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,806
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,038 (82%) are occupied, and 4,768 (18%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
       patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
       cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
       situation on 11/12/2020. The RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general population to be very
       high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as the
       occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and senior care homes.
       Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
       is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
       substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
