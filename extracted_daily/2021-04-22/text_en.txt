Since 6 March 2021, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has been publishing the English version of the COVID-19
situation reports for Germany on a weekly basis. Information on the daily epidemiological situation is
available on the RKI’s online COVID-19 dashboard. In addition, the RKI’s website provides daily situation
reports in German, information on vaccination data and from the intensive care registry, as well as other
regularly uploaded data. [Information sources at provided at the end of this report].
The following information is provided in this situation report: Overview on the epidemiological situation,
demographic distribution of cases, surveys on laboratory tests of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, and information
from additional RKI-based surveillance systems.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed through the following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung .

  according to the German Data Protection Act.
  Figure 2 shows the total number of cases with or without COVID-19-relevant symptoms as well as the
  proportion of hospitalised and deceased cases. Since deaths occur on average 2-3 weeks after infection,
  additional reports of deaths are expected for the most recent three weeks. The data used for this figure can

  Information on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      The RKI assesses the number of PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 carried out in Germany on a weekly basis by
      merging data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as clinical and outpatient laboratories
      throughout Germany. These data are shared voluntarily with the RKI from the following sources: An
      internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), the laboratory-
      based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
      (ARS)), and the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
      Table 2 shows the number of tests, the proportion of positive tests, as well as the number of reporting
      laboratories since the start of testing in Germany. Since laboratories can register and correct the tests from
      previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can change
      retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of people tested,
      since the data may include multiple tests from the same individuals within a time period of a few weeks
      (Table 2). Complete data since the beginning of testing are available through the following link:
      http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German). The current testing criteria can be found through the
      following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI-based surveillance
 systems on acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a platform at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI)
     within the population in Germany. In week 15, 2021, the total ARI rate remained stable. The ARI rate
     increased in the age groups 0 to 4 years and 15 to 34 years, but remained stable or decreased in all other
     age groups. Since week 36, 2020, the total ARI rate has been lower than in seasons 2017/18 and 2018/19
     and is now similar to values seen during 2019/20. Further information can be found through the following
     link: https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel primary care network. In week 15,
     2021, the total number of patient visits (consultations) due to ARI (ARI consultation rate) increased slightly.
     The ARI consultation rate increased for age groups below 60 years. The total ARI consultation rate was
     slightly higher compared to the values seen in 2020, but still lower compared to previous years. Through
     virological surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 63 of 145 sentinel samples (43%) in
     week 15, 2021. Among those, human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) was identified in 31 (21%) samples,
     rhinovirus in 24 (17%) samples, SARS-CoV-2 in ten (7%) samples, Parainfluenzavirus in three (2%) samples
     and Metapneumonvirus was found in one sample (1%). Further national and regional information can be
     found through the following links: https://influenza.rki.de/ and

       COVID-19 Situation Report 22/04/2021

       A third ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalised patients
       (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses of influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
       respiratory tract). The total number of SARI cases increased in week 14, 2021. The number of SARI cases
       increased substantially in the age group 35 to 59 years. In this age group, such high SARI case numbers were
       seen only once before during the unusually severe influenza season 2017/18. Of all reported SARI cases in
       week 14, 2021, 66% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). Please note that due to
       data availability, only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation
       duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

    Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers of COVID-19 and the increase in 7-day incidence, the RKI assesses
       the threat to the health of the general population in Germany to be very high. It highlights the ongoing
       community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of many outbreaks, particularly in
       households, day-care facilities for children and increasingly in schools, as well as in occupational settings.
       In light of the increase in variants of concern (VOC), which have higher infectiousness, a rigorous reduction
       of physical contacts, use of protective measures, as well as intensive efforts to contain outbreaks and chains
       of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect people who are
       vulnerable.
       On 21/04/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
       current version can be found through the following link: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in
       German).

  Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date that cases are received by the RKI. Due to delays in
        data sharing, cases from previous days may be included in today’s numbers.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of shared cases minus deaths and the estimated number of
        recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimating recovered cases takes into account information on disease onset and
        hospitalisation, but does not do so for late effects since these data are not recorded regularly.
