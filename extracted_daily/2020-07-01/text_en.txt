        Summary (as of 01/07/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
              total of 139 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 194,725 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,985 deaths due to COVID-19 have
              been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •     COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reportedsporadically in nursing homes and hospitals as well as
              refugee facilities.
        •     Outbreaks of COVID-19 in meat processing plants have been reported in several federal states. In
              the district of Guetersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, such an outbreak led to a high 7-day
              incidence of over 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 194,725
    (+466) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been electronically
    reported to and validated by the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 132 districts reported no cases in the past 7
    days. Information on laboratory-confirmed cases is also available on the RKI website
    at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and https://corona.rki.de.

    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown in 58,058 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

    cases with information available (01/07/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 166,453 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,042 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,388 of 23,189 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,288 (17%) of 169,476 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 179,800 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,853 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (Section 42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing
    plants.

      Outbreaks
      A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in two districts,
      the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia) and the district of Oldenburg (Lower Saxony).
      The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
      Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
      processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
      for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are in
      quarantine together with their household members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the
      district of Guetersloh were closed on 18/06/2020 until the end of the summer holidays (11/08/2020), in
      the neighboring district of Warendorf since 25/06/2020. On 23/06/2020, the state of North Rhine-
      Westphalia officially implemented the second stage of a lockdown for the districts of Guetersloh and
      Warendorf until 30/06/2020. Widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented in the affected
      region. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in the food retail sector, kiosk staff and residents of
      central shared accommodations are being tested in Gütersloh and Warendorf. Any resident can have a
      test performed free of charge.
      Currently, two further outbreaks in other meat processing plants are ongoing in the district of Wesel in
      Nort Rhine-Westphalia and the district of Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. Both plants were temporarily
      closed.
      A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals as well as refugee
      facilities.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

7                                                                                                                      7
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.86 (95%-prediction interval: 0.70 – 1.03)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 01/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-
      day average of the nowcasting curve. This compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value
      represents a slightly later course of infection of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-
      value is estimated at 0.79 (95% prediction interval: 0.71 – 0.87) and is based on electronically notified
      cases as of 01/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      After a temporary marked increase in the estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value),
      they have again decreased to a value of 1 or below over the past few days. The marked increase over
      the preceding days was related to increased case numbers mainly due to local, outbreak-related COVID-
      19 transmission with the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role (see
      section “Outbreaks”, above). The outbreak dynamics are also influenced in part by serial tests
      performed among possibly exposed persons, which led to the rapid detection of large numbers of
      additional COVID-19 cases in some of the outbreak settings. Since the case numbers in Germany are at a
      low level overall, local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction
      number. For this reason, the reproduction numbers may continue to fluctuate markedly.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available
      at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 01/07/2020, a total of 1,275 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,614
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,406 (66%) are occupied, and 11,208 beds (36%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
      well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
      are transmitted via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses
      (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the
      Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory
      medicine.

9                                                                                                                    9
       Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 26/2020, 5,873,563 laboratory tests
       have been recorded to date, 229,240 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (see Table 5).
       Up to and including week 26, 227 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
       one of the other transmitting networks and communicate mainly on a weekly basis.
       Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
       the numbers determined will increase subsequently. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
       the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
