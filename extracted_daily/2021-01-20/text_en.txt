      Summary (as of 20/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the
          health of the general population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 15,974 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,148 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 123 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,
          Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
      • Of 412 districts, 393 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 255 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000
          population and of these, 26 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 95 and of people ≥80 years 268 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 20/01/2021, 4,836 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care (-111 cases fewer than the day before). Due to ongoing
          corrections by several hospitals, today’s numbers of completed ICU treatments and new admissions to ICU as well as
          differences to the previous day are not reported.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,254,760 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.5%) and 42,670
          people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
      • In this situation report, the following additional information is given: SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests

  COVID-19 Situation Report 20/01/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of
  COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to decrease slightly; depending on the
  region.
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in
  nursing and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many
  districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
  especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide, for which both their effect on
  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations are being examined in detail. Since mid
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. By now there is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. Currently there is no evidence that infections with variant B.1.1.7 lead to
  more serious diseases. At least for the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty by BioNTech/Pfizer, an effectiveness
  against B.1.1.7 could be shown in first studies.
  Also in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa was reported,
  which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. The
  effectiveness of vaccines is currently being tested for this variant as well.
  Both variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection
  process is increasingly monitored by integrated molecular surveillance.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data
  transmission to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported
  incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,068,002
  (+15,974) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *In Brandenburg. some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 1,116,286 cases (54 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (20/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                  7-day R-value
                                0.79                                                            0.87
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.69 – 0.90)                          (95%-prediction interval: 0.81 – 0.93)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
    this means a high number of new infections per day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

     COVID-19 Situation Report 20/01/2021

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 20/01/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,076 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 22,753 (84%) are occupied, and 4,323 (16%) are currently available. The
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.
     Due to ongoing corrections by several hospitals, today’s numbers of completed ICU treatments and new
     admissions to ICU as well as differences to the previous day are not reported.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well
     as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data
     are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
     survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
     Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
     the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 2/2021, 37,449,922 PCR-laboratory
     tests have been recorded to date, 2,142,435 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
     Up to and including week 2/2021, 258 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or
     in one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis.
     Since laboratories can register and correct the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is
     possible that the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number
     of tests is not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of
     individual patients (Table 3) with data for the last 10 weeks – complete data since beginning of testing
     are available at http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German)).
     As testing criteria were adapted to the current situation of limited testing capacities in face of high case
     numbers and to take into account the common cold season, from week 46 onwards the proportion of
     positive tests cannot be compared directly to former weeks (Adapted testing criteria:

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the
     general population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2
     transmission as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and
     nursing and senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable
     groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections
     can be reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the
     new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

  Annex
     1
       The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former
     cases may be included.
     2
       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
     number of recovered cases.
     3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and
     hospitalization but not for late effects because such data were not recorded regularly.
     4
       Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are
     reported.
