      *No cases were transmitted from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Saxony and Saarland yesterday. There were technical problems with
      the transmission of data from Hamburg.
      As a result of quality checks and data cleansing by the health authorities and regional offices, corrections to cases already
      transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports) can lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,728 (17%) of 173,476 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 185,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,064 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 5,008 (55%) are men and 4,051 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,757 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
    care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
    persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
    female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
    among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
    reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
    Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia).
    The high but slowly decreasing 7-day incidence in this district is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
    plant. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The first employees were
    discharged from quarantine 14 days after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 hours after
    resolution of symptoms.
    A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
    well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 44 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.
    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 13/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 09/07/2020).
    A sensitive R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    possibly exposed persons, leading to therapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases.
    This can lead to relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the
    case in Germany - the total number of new cases is small.

      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.00 (95%-prediction interval: 0.78 – 1.25) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 13/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.83 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.74 – 0.95) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 13/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 13/07/2020, a total of 1,261 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,170
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,187 (63%) are occupied, and 11,983 beds (37%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
        transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
        German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
        short notice based on new insights.
        Infection risk
        The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
        behaviour.
        Disease severity
        In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
        increasing age and underlying illnesses.
        Burden on health system
        The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
        capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
        burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
