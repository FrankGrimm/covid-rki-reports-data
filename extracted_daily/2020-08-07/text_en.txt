COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 07/08/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    In the past few weeks, the number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
          has decreased markedly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal states. This
          trend is concerning.
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 6.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 57 districts transmitted zero
          cases over the past 7 days. In a further 213 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000
          inhabitants.
     •    In total, 214,214 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,183 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >400
          cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company and among employees of a canning
          company.
     •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
          nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, meat-processing plants
          and other occupational settings, educational settings, as well as in the context of religious or
          family events.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case outbreaks in different administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and
      health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning
      from travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also in
      outdoor settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community or face mask
      correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 214,214
      (+1,147) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 57 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days decreased
      continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 67,423 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 2.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (07/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 6,475 were children under 10 years of age (3.0%), 11,716 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.5%), 96.045 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 62,771 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (29%), 31,250 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,484 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.6%). The age and/or gender was unknown in 473 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of
  47 years (median age 47 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 181.433 (85%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (47%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,306
  cases (3.0%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance

  category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two
  symptoms was reported in 5,616 of 37,266 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 31,032 (17%) of 186,331 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 195,900 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,183 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.3% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,081 (55%) are men and 4,098 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
  five cases.
  The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,848 (85%) were
  in people aged 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Thus far, three deaths
  among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical
  conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases. Since
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases, the
  proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Five districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts of
  Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, the district of Rheingau-Taunus and the city Offenbach in Hesse, the
  district of Vechta in Lower Saxony and the district of Kleve in North Rhine-Westphalia.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to two outbreaks with >400 COVID-19-cases, one among harvest
  workers of an agricultural company and the other among employees in two of three locations of a

    canning company. Quarantine was ordered for all employees of both companies. The local population
    (3,300 inhabitants) has been offered voluntary testing.
    In the district of Offenbach the increase in case numbers is predominantly due to cases among returning
    travelers. In the district of Kleve transmission among guests of a large wedding party play contributed to
    the increase in case numbers. The sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the district of
    Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis is explained by an outbreak in an nursing home as well as cases among returning
    travellers.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    meat-processing plants and other occupational settings, family events, educational settings, as well as
    religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 07/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 03/08/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.

     The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.16 (95%-prediction interval: 0.92 – 1.42) and is based on
     electronically notified cases as of 07/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.16 (95% prediction
     interval: 1.02 – 1.33) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 07/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a larger
     number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased steadily in
     recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 06/08/2020

   Mortality Monitoring
       A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
       excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
       the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
       (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data,
       have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
       monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
       An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
       April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also
       among those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the
       Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. All-cause mortality for the countries in the
       EuroMOMO network has now largely returned to expected levels.
       Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with
       a certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
       https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
       Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
       Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
       of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all cause mortality was
       significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
       of May.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks).
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.

     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
