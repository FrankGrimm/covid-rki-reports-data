  COVID-19 Situation Report 08/07/2021
2
  As of 08/07/2021, 3,733,519 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 91,141 deaths associated with
  COVID-19 were shared with the RKI. The current national 7-day incidence is 5.2 cases per 100,000
  population.
  Since 26/12/2020, a total of 47,872,792 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination
  uptake 57.6%)4 and 33,909,828 people have been vaccinated fully against COVID-19 (vaccination uptake
  40.8%)5
  On 08/07/2021 (12:15 PM) 470 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. +17 COVID-19 patients were
  newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was -14 compared to the prior day. +9
  COVID-19 patients died on ICU since the prior day.
  In calendar week 26, 2021 the number of patients treated with acute respiratory illness continued to
  increase. It is now slightly higher compared to the usual average for this time of the year. It seems that the
  current behaviour of people does not prevent transmission of respiratory illnesses as before. However, the
  number of patients with severe acute respiratory illness in the hospitals participating in the Hospital
  Surveillance System ICOSARI slightly decreased. The percentage (5 %) of COVID-19 among those severely ill
  is comparable to the week before (4 %).

  federal state electronically reported to RKI, Germany (08/07/2021, 12:00 AM). The number of new cases includes positive cases
  reported to the local health department on the same day as well as on previous days.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed through the following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.

  the weeks 28 to 53, 2020, and weeks 01-26, 2021 (as of 06/07/2021, 12:00 AM). Data source: The mandatory surveillance system
  according to the German Data Protection Act.
  Figure 2 shows the total number of cases with or without COVID-19-relevant symptoms as well as the
  proportion of hospitalised and deceased cases. Since deaths occur on average 2-3 weeks after infection,
  additional reports of deaths are expected for the most recent three weeks. The data used for this figure can
  be accessed through the following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-tabelle-klinische-aspekte.

  Information on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      The RKI assesses the number of PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 carried out in Germany on a weekly basis by
      merging data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as clinical and outpatient laboratories
      throughout Germany. These data are shared voluntarily with the RKI from the following sources: An
      internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), the laboratory-
      based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
      (ARS)), and the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
      Table 2 shows the number of tests, the proportion of positive tests, as well as the number of reporting
      laboratories since the start of testing in Germany. Since laboratories can register and correct the tests from
      previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can change
      retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of people tested,
      since the data may include multiple tests from the same individuals within a time period of a few weeks
      (Table 2). Complete data since the beginning of testing are available through the following link:
      http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German). The current testing criteria can be found through the
      following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI-based surveillance
 systems on acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a platform at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI)
     within the population in Germany. In week 26, 2021, the ARI rate increased further in all age groups.
     Further information can be found through the following link: https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel primary care network. In week 26,
     2021, the number of patient visits (consultations) due to ARI (ARI consultation rate) increased in all age
     groups. The total ARI rates in both systems are slightly higher than the values seen in previous years.
     Through virological surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 116 of 159 sentinel samples
     (73%) in week 26, 2021. Among those, rhinovirus was found in 82 (52%) samples, parainfluenzavirus in 37
     (23%) samples, human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) in 12 (8%) samples. Human metapneumovirus and
     SARS-CoV-2 were found in one sample each (1%). Influenza virus or respiratory syncytialvirus (RSV) were
     detected in none of the 159 sentinel samples in week 26, 2021. Further national and regional information
     can be found through the following links: https://influenza.rki.de/ and
     https://influenza.rki.de/Diagrams.aspx?agiRegion=0.
     A third ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in newly hospitalised
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses of influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). The total number of SARI cases slightly decreased in week 26, 2021. Of all
     reported SARI cases in week 26, 2021, 5% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4).
     Please note that only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis were included in this
     analysis. Data for the recent weeks are preliminary.
     Note: This report is a current snapshot and is updated on a weekly base.

      Figure 4: Weekly number of newly hospitalised SARI cases (ICD-10 codes J09-J22) and proportion of cases with a diagnosis of COVID-
      19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) among SARI cases with date of admission in weeks 12, 2020 to 26, 2021. Data are derived from 72 sentinel
      hospitals.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      Despite the recent decrease in case numbers the RKI assesses the threat to the health of the general
      population in Germany to be high, due to the current dynamic of the SARS-CoV-2 variant distribution and
      the still not high enough rate of vaccinations. The chains of infection can be retraced more easily, but
      outbreaks, particularly in households, day-care facilities for children and in schools, as well as in
      occupational settings are still found. The variants of concern (VOC) are spreading more easily and are
      leading to more severe infections.
      In light of this increase in VOC a rigorous reduction of physical contacts, use of protective measures, as well
      as intensive efforts to contain outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of
      new infections and to protect people who are vulnerable.
      On 25/06/2021, the risk assessment was updated. The current version can be found through the following
      link: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

  Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date that cases are received by the RKI. Due to delays in
        data sharing, cases from previous days may be included in today’s numbers.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of shared cases minus deaths and the estimated number of
        recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimating recovered cases takes into account information on disease onset and
        hospitalisation, but does not do so for late effects since these data are not recorded regularly.
      4
        The number of persons vaccinated at least once includes all individuals who have received at least one
        dose of the BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or Janssen vaccines.
      5
        Vaccinated fully means: Vaccinated twice with the AstraZeneca or BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, or once
        with the Janssen vaccine, or once with any of the available vaccines for those with a prior COVID-19
        infection.
