      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

      Summary (as of 02/02/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of
          threat to the health of the general population to be very high.
      • Yesterday, 6,114 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 861 new deaths associated with COVID-19
          were transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 90 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,
          Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
      • In 366 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high. In 146 districts, the 7-day incidence is >100
          cases/100,000 population and in 5 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 71 and of people aged ≥80 years, 172
          cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters
          especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 02/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,264 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +493 existing patients had
          been discharged (30% of whom had died) and +435 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was -58 more than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,980,211 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate
          2.4%) and 606,786 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 02/02/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI classifies all cases of laboratory
  confirmation via SARS-CoV-2-nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) detection or SARS-CoV-2 isolation as COVID-19
  cases, regardless of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, in the following report the term
  "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers have been slowly decreasing.
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this nonetheless means that the number of new infections is decreasing per day yet remains high.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number
  of serious cases and deaths remains at a high level. These can only be avoided if all persons prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by wearing a surgical mask or masks marked with N95 or KN95 or FFP2 correctly.
  Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide. Their effect on the spread of SARS-
  CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations on these variants are being examined in detail. Since mid-
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. There is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. There are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with
  variant B.1.1.7 may lead to more severe diseases. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that mRNA
  vaccine efficacy is unlikely to be strongly affected by variant B.1.1.7.
  Also, in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. For this
  virus variant, too, laboratory tests show that the efficacy of the licensed mRNA vaccines is only minimally
  affected. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of
  Amazonas. Travels, which are non-essential, should be avoided – especially due to the circulation of new
  virus mutations.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection process is
  increasingly monitored through integrated molecular surveillance.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,162,260 cases (52 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (02/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Figure 2: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=2,224,301 cases with respective data in
  the weeks 10 to 53, 2020 and week 01-04, 2021 (02/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  After the first wave until reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence remained low and has
  increased steadily starting in younger age-groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups.
  Until the end of 2020 an increase of the 7-day incidence could be seen in all age groups, especially in the
  age groups 80 years and older. Since reporting week 02 the incidence decreased slightly.

  Figure 3 displays the percentages of deceased, hospitalized and symptomatic cases (COVID-19 relevant
  symptoms). The percentage of deaths among cases was less than 1% between week 30 and 41. An
  increasing trend is visible from week 36 onwards. In the weeks 47 to 53 it is between 2.3 and 3.8% and
  decreases since the beginning of the new year. As deaths occur on average only 2-3 weeks after infection,
  further reports of deaths are expected for weeks 02 – 04/2021. The proportion of hospitalized COVID-19
  cases increased from 5% in week 35 to 12% in week 53 and is decreasing slightly since the beginning of the
  new year. The percentage of cases with COVID-19 relevant symptoms is since week 38 over 80%. These

  percentages may equally change due to delayed reporting and data corrections. During the summer (weeks
  26-36) these proportions were lower at 65% and 77%. During that time period returning travelers were
  increasingly tested, among whom asymptomatic infections were detected more frequently. The data on
  which the figure is based and that were published here on previous Tuesdays can be found at:

  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 deaths according to week of death for the reporting weeks 10 – 53, 2020 and week 01-04,
  2021 (02/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
  The figures on the first page show the number of deaths reported daily according to date of entry at RKI. This
  may also include cases with a date of death several days in the past. Figure 4 shows the reported COVID-19
  deaths by calendar week according to the date of death. For recent weeks, further reports of deaths among
  reported cases can be expected.
  A significant increase in the number of deaths was observed since week 37. Since week 53, the number of
  reported deaths is slightly decreasing considerably. Of all deaths, 51,520 (89%) were among people aged 70
  years or older, with a median age of 84 years (Table 3), while this age group accounts for only 16% of all cases.
  Thus far, 12 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Nine of these
  deaths are validated; these children and adolescents were between 0 and 17 years of age, and seven of seven
  with information in this regard had known pre-existing conditions.

  Possible countries of exposure
  In weeks 01-04 2021, of the 438,673 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of
  exposure was missing in 198,054 (45%) cases.
  The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the summer vacation
  period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week.
  Since then, it has decreased to currently 300 cases in week 52, 2020. Since the Christmas holidays, the
  number of cases has initially gone up again, to 1.240 in week 02, and is now decreasing again, to 343 cases
  in MW 04, 2021. In the weeks 01-014 2021, a total of 3,214 persons (less than 1% of cases with information)
  reported a possible site of infection abroad.
  Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
  quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (for further details
  see https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende).
  Outbreaks
  The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is known
  to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated
  incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After further case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, while values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently
  estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                                0.85                                                            0.85
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.74 – 0.94)                            (95%-prediction interval: 0.79 – 0.90)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany,
    this nonetheless means that the number of new infections is decreasing per day yet remains high.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 02/02/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,007 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 22,545 (83%) are occupied, and 4,462 (17%) beds are currently available.
     The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
     population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
     as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
     senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
     is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
     reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-
     CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

   Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
      transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
      number of recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
      hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
      4
        Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
      reported.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
