4 COVID-19-Lagebericht vom 26.03.2020
    Countries other than Germany were mentioned as place of exposure 9,046 times, most frequently
    Austria and Italy. Regional data were only available for some of the foreign exposure sites, so that
    these figures can only be regarded as a minimum (for the most frequently named countries, see Table
    3).
    Time course
    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 25/03/2020. In 15,251 cases, onset
    of symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    alternatively by date of reporting from 20/02/2020 (26/03/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Demographic distribution
    Among these cases, 19,813 are male (55%) and 16,565 female (45%). In total, 267 children under the
    age of 5, 740 children aged 5 to 14 years, 28,017 persons aged 15 to 59 years and 7,344 persons 60
    years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 144 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 47 years.

      Clinical aspects
      Clinical information is available for 26,250 of the notified cases, of which 870 cases were reported as
      not having any symptoms considered significant for COVID-19. The most common manifestations are
      cough (14,202; 54%), fever (10,784; 41%), rhinorrhoea (6,158; 23%) and pneumonia (429; 2%).
      Hospitalisation was reported in 2,664 (10%) of the 26,563 COVID-19 cases with data available.
      An estimated 5,900 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases were considered to
      have recovered if they had a known onset of disease on or before 12/03/2020, were not reported to
      have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged and did
      not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of illness onset, symptoms,
      hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
      The 198 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 131 men and 66
      women. The median age was 83 years and the range 42 to 100 years. Of all deaths, 155 (78%) were in
      persons 70 years or older (but only 9% of all cases). Two further deaths related to COVID-19 were
      reported in 2 German tourists on a Nile cruise in Egypt.
      Laboratory tests
      RKI launched a nationwide laboratory survey to determine the number of laboratory tests being
      performed for SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. This survey is supplemented by 3 further data collections from
      the Network for Respiratory Diseases (RespVir, RKI), the national network for the surveillance of
      antibiotic resistance in Germany (ARS, RKI) and the Association of Accredited Medical Laboratories in
      Germany (ALM e.V.). From the response of 174 laboratories thus far, a total of at least 483,295
      samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020, most in calendar weeks 11 and 12. Of these,
      33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe
      and fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI
      currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high, but as very high for
      risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing
      previous illnesses. The risk varies from region to region. The burden on the health care system
      depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment
      measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some regions. This
      assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
