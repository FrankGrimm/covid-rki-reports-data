  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    Case numbers1
      With over 8,000 cases the number of COVID-19-cases can no longer be updated and validated manually.
      Therefore the reporting is changed. As of March 17, epidemiological evaluations in the COVID-19 situation report
      are based only on electronically transmitted data available to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at the time of the
      data closure (0:01 am).
      A total of 8,198 (+1,042) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been detected
      in Germany since 27/01/2020, which were electronically reported to and validated at the RKI. So far, 12 deaths
      related to COVID-19 diseases were electroniclally reported.
      Information on laboratory-confirmed cases
      So far, 8,198 cases in 16 federal states have been laboratory-confirmed and electronically reported (see Table 1
      and Figure 1).

    Information on electronically reported cases (8,198 cases, 18/03/2020, 0:01 am)
    8,198 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-cases from all 16 federal states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 8,198 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (18/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 4,605 are male (56%) and 3,568 female (44%). The age range is from 0 to 96 years, including
    67 children under the age of 5, 199 children aged 5 to 14 years, 6,557 persons aged 15 to 59 years and 1,337
    persons 60 years and older (see Figure 2). The age of 38 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 47 years.

    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 17/03/2020. In 3,561 cases, onset of
    symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

      of symptoms and alternatively by date of reporting (18/03/2020)
      Further information
      The 12 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 7 men and 5 women, from
      the 3 federal states Northrhine-Westfalia (6), Bavaria (4) and Baden-Wurttemberg (2). All deceased were older
      than 65 years of age; the mean age was 80 years and the medan age 82.5 years).
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as high. However, this risk varies from region to region.
      The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The
      burden on the health care system depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and
      initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some
      regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
