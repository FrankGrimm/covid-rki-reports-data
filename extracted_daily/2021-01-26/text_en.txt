      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
      – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
      Summary (as of 26/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the
          health of the general population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 6,412 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 903 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 108 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,
          Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence. Due to technical issues today, there has
          been a small difference between cases displayed in the Dashboard and given in this report. These issues are currently
          being resolved.
      • Of 412 districts, 387 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 209 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000
          population and of these, 9 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 85 and of people ≥80 years 224 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 26/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,571 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +580 existing patients
          had been discharged (29% of whom had died) and +532 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was -48 more than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,638,425 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.0%) and
          283,264 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 26/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of
  COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to decrease in almost all regions.
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in
  nursing and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many
  districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the
  number of serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a medical mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially
  indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide, for which both their effect on
  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations are being examined in detail. Since mid-
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. By now there is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. Currently there is no evidence that infections with variant B.1.1.7 lead to
  more serious diseases. At least for the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty by BioNTech/Pfizer, an effectiveness
  against B.1.1.7 could be shown in first studies.
  Also in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. The
  effectiveness of vaccines is currently being tested for this variant as well. Furthermore, a SARS-CoV-2
  variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of Amazonas.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data
  acquisition in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection
  process is increasingly monitored by integrated molecular surveillance.

  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data
  transmission to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported
  incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.
  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,148,077
  (+6,412) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  each federal state electronically reported to RKI, Germany (26/01/2021, 12:00 AM). The number of new cases includes positive
  cases notified to the local health department at the same day, but also at previous days.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 1,140,990 cases (53 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (26/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Figure 2: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=2,140,185 cases with respective data
  in the weeks 10 to 53, 2020 and week 01-03, 2021 (26/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and
  age-specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  After the first wave until reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence remained low and has
  increased steadily starting in younger age-groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups.
  Until the end of 2020 an increase of the 7-day incidence could be seen in all age groups, especially in the
  age groups 80 years and older. Since reporting week 02 the incidence decreased slightly.

  Figure 3 displays the percentages of deceased, hospitalized and symptomatic cases (COVID-19 relevant
  symptoms). The percentage of deaths among cases was less than 1% between week 30 and 41. An
  increasing trend is visible from week 36 onwards. In the weeks 47 to 53 it is between 2.3 and 3.5%. As
  deaths occur on average only 2-3 weeks after infection, further reports of deaths are expected for weeks
  01 – 03/2021. The proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 cases increased from 5% in week 35 to 11% in
  week 53 and is decreasing slightly since the beginning of the new year. The percentage of cases with
  COVID-19 relevant symptoms is since week 38 over 80%. These percentages may equally change due to
  delayed reporting and data corrections. During the summer (weeks 26-36) these proportions were lower
  at 65% and 77%. During that time period returning travelers were increasingly tested, among whom

  2021 (26/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  The figures on the first page show the number of deaths reported daily according to date of entry at RKI.
  This may also include cases with a date of death several days in the past. Figure 4 shows the reported
  COVID-19 deaths by calendar week according to the date of death. For recent weeks, further reports of
  deaths among reported cases can be expected.
  A significant increase in the number of deaths was observed since week 37. Since week 53, the number of
  reported deaths is slightly decreasing. Of all deaths, 47,073 (89%) were among people aged 70 years or
  older, with a median age of 84 years (Table 3), while this age group accounts for only 16% of all cases.
  Thus far, 12 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Nine of
  these deaths are validated; these children and adolescents were between 0 and 17 years of age, and seven
  of seven with information in this regard had known pre-existing conditions.

  Possible countries of exposure
  In weeks 53, 2020 to week 03, 2021, of the 482,479 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the
  country of exposure was missing in 226,097 (49%) cases.
  The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the summer vacation
  period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week.
  Since then, it has decreased to currently 300 cases in week 52, 2020. Since the Christmas holidays, the
  number of cases has initially gone up again, to 1,158 cases in week 02, and is now decreasing again, to
  511 cases in MW 03, 2021. In the weeks 53, 2020 to 03, 2021, a total of 3,043 persons (about 1% of
  cases with information) reported a possible site of infection abroad.
  Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
  quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (for further
  details see https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende).
  Outbreaks
  The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is
  known to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the
  elevated incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                  7-day R-value
                                0.85                                                            0.88
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.74 – 0.98)                          (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 – 0.95)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 26/01/2021, 12 AM, considering cases up to 22/01/2021).
    The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
    this means a high number of new infections per day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 26/01/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,991 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 22,566 (84%) are occupied, and 4,425 (16%) beds are currently available.
     The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the
     general population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2
     transmission as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and
     nursing and senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable
     groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections
     can be reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the
     new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

   Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former
      cases may be included.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
      number of recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and
      hospitalization but not for late effects because such data were not recorded regularly.
      4
        Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are
      reported.
