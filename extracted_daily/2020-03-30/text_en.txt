  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 00:00 AM daily). Because of week-end related staff
      shortages and technical problems, numbers in this report may be lower than those from other sources.
      Since 27/01/2020, a total of 57,298 (+4,751) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 455 deaths. (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and

    authority.
    Time course
    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 29/03/2020. In 23,915 cases, onset
    of symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    data available (30/03/2020, 00:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Clinical information is available for 40,931 of the notified cases. The most common manifestations are
    cough (21,716; 53%), fever (16,858; 41%), rhinorrhoea (9,281; 23%) and pneumonia (771; 2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported in 4,904 (12%) of the 41,444 COVID-19 cases with data available.
    An estimated 13,500 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases were considered to
    have recovered if they had a known onset of disease on or before 16/03/2020, were not reported to
    have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged and did
    not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of illness onset, symptoms,
    hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
    The 455 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 303 (67%) men
    and 151 (33%) women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 100 years. Of all deaths, 397
    (87%) were in persons 70 years or older. Of all reported cases only 11% were 70 years or older.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe
      and fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI
      currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high, but as very high for
      risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing
      previous illnesses. The risk varies from region to region. The burden on the health care system
      depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment
      measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some regions. This
      assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     The following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:
                 o     District of Heinsberg (North Rhine-Westphalia) since 12/03/2020
    International risk areas
      -     The following countries and regions are classified as risk areas (29/03/2020)
            (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete.html):
                 o Austria
                 o Egypt
                 o Iran
                 o Italy
                 o In France: Region Grand Est (this region includes Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne-
                       Ardenne) and Îles-de-France (incl. Paris)
                 o In South Korea: The province of Gyeongsangbuk-do (North-Gyeongsang)
                 o In Spain: Madrid,the provinces Navarra and La Rioja and the Basque Country (Pais Vasco)
                 o In Switzerland: the cantons of Tessin, Waadt and Geneva
                 o In the United States: The states of California, Washington, New York and New Jersey
      The province of Hubei in China is no longer classified as an international risk area.
    Other measures
      -     A new federal law was implemented on 28/03/2020 for the protection of the public in the event of
            epidemic situations, granting the federal government additional competencies for the control of
            epidemics. The federal government can now enact decrees such as limiting public transport and
            securing provision of pharmaceuticals, medical products, disinfectants, and laboratory diagnosis.
            Measures to strengthen resources in the health care sector and to enable exceptions to building
            regulations, for instance to enable the construction of medical treatment centers at short notice,
            are made possible. A compensation arrangement for parents experiencing reduced income due to
            child care requirements was additionally included.
