  The difference to previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay of data transmission former cases may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
    – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
    Summary (as of 14/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
        strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 141,3 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 97 cases/100.000 population.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Saxony is higher than the
        national total 7-day incidence.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 4 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
        today, 37 districts have an incidence of >25-50 cases /100,000 population, 101 districts have an incidence of >50-100
        cases/100,000 population, 270 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 21 districts have
        an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
    • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households, but also in
        community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to religious events
        For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has increased in the past 2 weeks from 1,944 patients on
        31/10/2020 to 3,325 patients on 14/11/2020.
    • On 14/11/2020, 22,641 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 178 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
        transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 14/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating and is
      currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still
      a high number of new cases every day.
      The data table on page 1 was adapted on November 11. The aim of the change is to focus on the current
      situation primarily. Therefore, changes to the previous day are given priority. Reporting data from other
      surveillance systems will become more visible. In particular data on ICU capacities are of great
      importance in the current situation.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including households and in old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts
      there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 773,556
  (+22,641) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 404,085 cases (52%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (14/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 59% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 74% were female and 26% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Due to changes in data registration, not all data entries for cases ascertained in the most recent version of the surveillance software could be
  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (408 of 412). By now, 270 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 21 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  101 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50-100 cases/100,000 population and 37 districts have a 7-day
  incidence of > 25-50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected
  districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many small
  outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  and community facilities, kindergartens and schools, various occupational settings and in the context of
  religious gatherings continue to contribute to the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany. Values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
    less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 14/11/2020, a total of 1,288 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,184
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,631 (77%) are occupied, and 6,553 (23%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown inTable 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent increase in case numbers with severe disease, which have to be treated in ICUs and
     the increasingly tense situation in the health system the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     situation on 11/11/2020. The current version can be found here:
