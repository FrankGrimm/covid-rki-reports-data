COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 14/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore,
     the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 31.5 cases per 100,000 population.
 • In comparison, the 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in North Rhine-Westphalia,
     Saarland and Hesse moderately higher and in Baden-Wuerttemberg slightly higher than the national mean 7-
     day incidence.
 • The districts Berlin – Neukoelln, Bitburg-Pruem and Berlin – Mitte exceeded a 7-day incidence of 100
     cases/100,000 population. The 7-day incidence was 50 to 100 cases/100,000 population in 44 districts, in 123
     additional districts it exceeded 25 cases/100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. From
     week 40 onwards, an increase has been observed in all age groups.
 • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are
     being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes and hospitals, facilities
     for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-processing plants, various occupational settings,
     and among travellers.
 • In total, 334,585 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,677 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
     electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
 • The RKI has published recommendations on test criteria and prevention measures at schools during the
     COVID-19 pandemic.
 • The National Testing Strategy was updated and includes targeted antigen testing and extension of testing to
     further population groups.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 14/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently considerably increasing, while the proportion of cases
      among travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. Since the end of September, an increase of
      the R-values, which are above one, can be observed.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially, in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can mainly be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.
      The National Testing Strategy was updated on the basis of an ordinance on testing for SARS-CoV-2 which
      will enter into force on 15 October 2020. The overall objective of the National Testing Strategy remains
      the care for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the protection of vulnerable groups and the prevention of the
      spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The update includes the targeted use of antigen testing and the
      extension of testing to more population groups.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 131,699 cases (39%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (14/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 29% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 170 districts,
  including 2 city districts in Berlin (Neukoelln, Mitte) and the district of Bitburg-Pruem with an incidence
  of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 44 additional districts with a 7-day incidences of >50
  cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de)) shows all affected districts.
  Currently, in most districts it is mostly a diffuse situation with increased frequency of COVID-10 cases in
  connection with private celebrations with family and friends. In several affected districts larger
  outbreaks are the cause of the sharp increase in case numbers. However, many smaller outbreaks in
  nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, schools and
  kindergarten, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events, continue to
  contribute to the increase in incidence.
  The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin is due to more diffuse transmission. Stricter distancing
  rules and opening restrictions for restaurants, bars and shops are applied since 10/10/2020.
  In the district of Bitburg-Pruem, too, private birthday parties have contributed significantly to the spread
  of the infections.
  Among the 44 other districts with more than 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants, the increase in incidence in
  the following districts can be attributed mainly to a single outbreak:
  In the district of Cloppenburg 89 cases are related to an outbreak among workers of a slaughterhouse.
  In the district of Esslingen, a cargo centre has developed as a hotspot for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
  addition to a diffuse situation of infection.
  In the city Hamm, more than 200 corona infections are associated with a wedding.

     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.
                            4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                  1.04                                                             1.16
           (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 – 1.26)                               (95%-prediction interval: 1.04 – 1.29)
     Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
     less affected because every day of the week is used to determine the value.
     Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
     cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
     electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 14/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 10/10/2020).
     Since the end of September, an increase of the R-values, which are above one, can be observed.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
     23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 14/10/2020, a total of 1,280 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,208
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,496 (71%) are occupied, and 8,712 (29%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
    number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
    important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
    before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    To assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
    clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
    survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
    Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
    the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 41/2020, 19,276,507 laboratory tests
    have been recorded to date, 375,995 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 4 – complete
    data since beginning of testing are available at www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German)).
    Up to and including week 41, 253 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
    one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the
    ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the
    same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
    (Table 4).

      Testing of travellers at German points of entry
      At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres
      have been established. Some of the laboratories attached to those test centres have voluntarily provided
      aggregated statistics on the number of tests. For week 41/2020, 31,687 tests were reported from these
      entry points, of which 421 were positive (1.3%). It is not possible to say to which extent these 31,687
      tests are included in those reported in Table 4.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
