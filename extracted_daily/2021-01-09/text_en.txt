      Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
      data were not recorded regularly.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

      Summary (as of 09/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general
           population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 24,694 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1.083 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the
           RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 154 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national
           incidence.
      • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 320 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
           49 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and two districts have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 123 and of people ≥80 years 298 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,
           occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 09/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 5,414 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +736 existing patients had been
           discharged (33% of whom had died) and +666 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was -70 more than
           the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 532,878 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (6,4 vaccinated per 1,000 population)
           (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
      • Testing and notification activities may have been lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete picture of the
           epidemiological situation in Germany of the previous two weeks.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 09/01/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
      detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
      following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
      19 disease.
      General current assessment
      Since the beginning of December, there has been a renewed sharp rise in the number of cases. During the
      holidays, the number of cases decreased. In the last few days, the number of cases has risen again. Whether
      this trend will continue, beyond the expected retesting and re-reporting, will only become clear in the
      course of the next few days.
      The R-value is currently around 1. However, due to the still very high number of infected persons in
      Germany, this still means a high number of new infections per day. Due to the recent holidays, there may
      still be a delay in the detection, recording and transmission of COVID-19 cases, so that the R-value should
      be interpreted with caution.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
      and long-term care homes, occupational settings and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is an
      increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
      Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
      serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.
      On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. To date, it is unknown how the new
      virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been detected in
      numerous countries around the world. So far, a few cases of this new variant have been transmitted to the
      RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new virus variant detected in South
      Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility and more severe disease.
      Due to the holidays, it should be noted when interpreting the case numbers that, on the one hand, fewer
      people usually visited a doctor, as a result of which fewer samples were taken and fewer laboratory tests
      were performed. This may lead to fewer notified cases at the local level and hence to fewer transmitted
      COVID-19 cases to the RKI. Furthermore, not all local and state health authorities transmit data to the RKI
      on all days.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,891,581
  (+24,694) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases were detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,045,962 cases (55%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases were detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported in all 412 districts. There
  are 49 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days and there are two districts
  with an incidence if >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is known
  to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated
  incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                          7-day R-value
                                1.46                                                                 1.17
         (95%-prediction interval: 1.19 – 1.75)                                   (95%-prediction interval: 1.05 – 1.30)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value. During the festive season COVID-19 cases were detected, notified and
  transmitted with delays, thus the R-value may be under-estimated.

    *During the festive season COVID-19 cases were detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
    The R-value is currently around 1. However, due to the still very high number of infected persons in
    Germany, this still means a high number of new infections per day. Due to the recent holidays, there may
    still be a delay in the detection, recording and transmission of COVID-19 cases, so that the R-value should
    be interpreted with caution.

    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

      COVID-19 Situation Report 09/01/2021

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
      with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
      with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 09/01/2021, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,932
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,568 (84%) are occupied, and 4,364 (16%) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
      as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
      senior care homes.
      Therefore. more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
      is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
      substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
