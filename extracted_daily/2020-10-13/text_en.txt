COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 13/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore,
     the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 29.6 cases per 100,000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse g and in
     Baden-Wuerttemberg slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • The districts Berlin - Neukoelln and Mitte, as well as the districts Cloppenburg and Delmenhorst exceeded a 7-
     day incidence of 100 cases/100,000 population. The 7-day incidence was 50 to 100 cases/100,000 population
     in 36 districts, in 114 additional districts it exceeded 25 cases/100,000 population.
  • Since the beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. From
     week 40 onwards, an increase has been observed in all age groups.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are
     being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes and hospitals, facilities
     for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-processing plants, various occupational settings,
     and among travellers.
  • In total, 325,331 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,621 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
     electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
  • The RKI has published recommendations on test criteria and prevention measures at schools during the
     COVID-19 pandemic.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 13/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      Recommendations on test criteria and prevention measures at schools during the COVID-19 pandemic
      The publications presented in the following paragraph are recommendations of the Robert Koch
      Institute, the regulation and application of the measures described lies within the responsibility of the
      federal states.
      The central objectives for these presented measures are to maintain a reliable and continuous in-person
      teaching experience for all students, to avoid complete school closures, and to prevent and protect all
      those affected, rather than react.
      The risk reduction measures in schools include behavioral recommendations for all persons affected, the
      organization of the administrative side and, wherever possible, the inclusion of spatial and technical
      conditions.
      Preventive measures in schools during the COVID 19 pandemic:
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Praevention-
      Schulen.pdf?__blob=publicationFile
      The recommendations on test criteria in schools are designed especially for a case of a shortage of test
      capacities and a high burden on outpatient care. Therefore, the highest priority is given to symptomatic
      individuals depending on the local/regional situation, individual exposure risk or whether the persons are
      considered part of a vulnerable group or close contact with such individuals in family, private
      environment or through professional activity or membership of a group at risk of frequent transmission.
      The recommended test strategy is intended to support the decision making of health authorities and
      treating physicians.

      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently considerably increasing, while the proportion of cases
      among travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. Since the end of September, an increase of
      the R-values, which are above one, can be observed.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious

  settings, or, especially, in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
  current development must be further carefully monitored.
  Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
  1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
  virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
  follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
  experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
  more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
  severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
  continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
  hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can mainly be prevented through
  decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
  especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
  of family and friends.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 129,129 cases (39%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 2 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
  the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
  proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
  from reporting week 17 to reporting week 25, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
  cases. This development continued in the following weeks. By comparison, the proportion of cases in the
  younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
  decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
  a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations. Absolute case numbers increased from week 29. Since
  reporting week 36, however, case numbers have increased again, with considerable increase in the
  proportion of cases among older age groups.
  Figure 3: Presentation of the notified COVID-19 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants in Germany by age group and reporting week
  (13/10/2020, 12 AM)
  Figure 3 shows that at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, COVID-19 incidence increased initially
  among 15-34 year olds and 35-59 year olds, followed by older persons over 80 years of age. After the
  decline in incidence for all age groups, the highest incidence since the renewed increase in case numbers
  is currently seen in the age group of 15 to 34-year-olds, followed by the age group of 5 to 14-year-olds
  and now also the 35-59-year-olds. The incidence increased among persons 60 years of age and older
  from week 36 and from week 40 onwards, an increase can be observed for all age groups.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 261,502 (80%) of the notified cases. Among these, cough
  (43%), fever (35%), rhinorrhoea (22%) and sore throat (20%) were reported most and 14% had no or no
  relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Pneumonia was reported in 6,003 cases (2.3%). Since calendar week 17,
  cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and
  anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in 19,789
  of 116,894 cases (17%).

  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 279,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

  Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The proportion of
  deaths among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it decreased
  markedly until week 34 and has remained well under 1% since then. The proportion of cases reported
  with no or no symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until week 34 to 35%, but decreased
  since then to below 20% after week 38. During the weeks with the highest proportion of cases with no or

  Germany was also highest (see Figure 5).

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to day of death are shown by calendar week in Figure 4.
  Of all deaths, 8,211 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 13% of all cases were in this
  age group (Table 3). Thus far, two deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI*. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for both of them. The number of
  deaths may change after data validation is completed.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 29% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.

  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

   In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
   place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of
   reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting a
   probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined
   again since, to currently 4.3% (Figure 5). In weeks 38-41, 5320 persons reported a possible site of
   infection abroad.
   Table 5 lists the top 16 countries in addition to Germany most frequently reported as the probable place
   of infection in weeks 38 to 41. Turkey, Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Austria and Italy were most
   frequently reported as the country of exposure.

   The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad increased significantly after the
   opening of borders in calendar week 25, but has been declining again since week 35 (see Figure 5).
   Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be
   greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and hygiene and
   avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
   immediately. In addition, travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
   maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
   https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
   Outbreaks
   An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 154 districts,
   including 2 city districts in Berlin (Neukoelln, Mitte) , the district of Cloppenburg and the city of
   Delmenhorst with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 40 districts with a 7-day
   incidences of >50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) shows all affected
   districts
   Currently, in most districts it is mostly a diffuse situation with increased frequency of COVID-10 cases in
   connection with private celebrations with family and friends. In several affected districts larger
   outbreaks are the cause of the sharp increase in case numbers. However, many smaller outbreaks in
   nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, schools and

     kindergarten, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events, continue to
     contribute to the increase in incidence.
     The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin is due to more diffuse transmission. Stricter distancing
     rules and opening restrictions for restaurants, bars and shops are applied since 10/10/2020.
     Among the 32 districts with more than 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants, the increase in incidence in the
     following districts can be attributed mainly to a single outbreak:
     In the district of Cloppenburg 89 cases are related to an outbreak among workers of a slaughterhouse.
     In the district of Esslingen, a cargo centre has developed as a hotspot for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
     addition to a diffuse situation of infection.
     In the city Hamm, more than 200 corona infections are associated with a wedding.
     In the Wesermarsch district, the increase in incidence is directly related to the incidence of infections at
     the childcare facilities and schools in Lemwerder.
     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.

       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.

       As of 12/10/2020, a total of 1,279 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,276
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,330 (70%) are occupied, and 8,946(30%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
