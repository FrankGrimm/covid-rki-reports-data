 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 04/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
      COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. It is therefore still necessary for
      the entire population to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 16.2 cases per 100,000 population. The 7-day
      incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 population in 6 districts: the city of Hamm, the city of
      Remscheid, the districts of Berlin Mitte, Berlin Neukölln, Berlin Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and the
      district of Vechta. In a further 42 districts, it exceeded 25 cases/100,000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in North Rhine-Westphalia and
      Hamburg moderately higher, and in Hesse slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • In total, 299,237 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,529 deaths associated with COVID-19
      have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
      clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
      and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
      settings, and among travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 04/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The R-value has been predominantly slightly
      greater than 1 since the beginning of September.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can only be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 299,237
  (+2,279) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1). A total of 10 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a
  total of 139 districts reported zero cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 112.736 cases (38%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (04/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 48 districts,
  including the city of Hamm, the city of Remscheid, the districts of Berlin Mitte, Berlin Neukölln, Berlin
  Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and the district of Vechta with 7-day incidences of >50 cases/100,000
  population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to about 200 cases in connection with a
  wedding. More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine
  (https://www.hamm.de/corona). Stricter distancing measures have been implemented in Hamm
  (https://www.hamm.de/aktuelles/weitere-corona-massnahmen-beschlossen).
  The increased incidence in Berlin Neukölln and Berlin Mitte is due to more diffuse transmission, including
  spread among young and international travellers and party guests, who contracted the infection during
  travel or at parties and subsequently infected household members and family. In the district of Berlin
  Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg a 7-day incidence of >50 cases/100,000 population since the 04.10.2020 was
  reported as well.
  In the district of Vechta a 7-day-incidence of >50 cases/100,000 population was reported with 50 cases
  linked to an outbreak in a long-term care facility (https://www.landkreis-
  vechta.de/nc/service/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/einzelansicht/news/50-infektionen-gemeldet-
  corona-ausbruch-in-vechtaer-pflegeheim.html).
  In the city of Remscheid the high incidence is primarily due to smaller outbreaks in day care centres and
  schools with spread to outside contacts. Stricter control measures have been implemented
  (https://remscheid.de/corona#chapter146380100000143530-1015_sp_main_iterate_1_0).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 04/10/2020
6
  Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to transmission at family and other private events. The
  proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-19-related
  outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community
  facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
  extracted from the notification system.
                         4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                               1.23                                                             1.14
        (95%-prediction interval: 0.98 – 1.53)                               (95%-prediction interval: 1.00 – 1.29)
  Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 04/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 30/09/2020).
  The reported R values have been predominantly greater than 1 since the second week in September.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
  23/04/2020).
