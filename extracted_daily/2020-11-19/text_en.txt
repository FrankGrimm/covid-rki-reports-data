  The difference to previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay of data transmission former cases may be included.

  Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 19/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
        strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 139 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 105 cases/100,000 population.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony is higher than the national total
        7-day incidence.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 7 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000 population. In
        comparison, 264 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 19 districts have an incidence
        of >250 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households,
        but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to
        religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • Since mid of October, the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has strongly increased, from 655 patients
        on October 15th to 3,588 patients on 19/11/2020.
    • On 19/11/2020, 22,609 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 251 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
        been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 19/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating and is
      currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still
      a high number of new cases every day.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including households and in old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts
      there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 855,916
  (+22,609) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 452,491 cases (53%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (19/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  As of 18/11/2020, the number and proportion of persons ≥ 60 years old are reported in each category of
  Table 2.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (405 of 412). There are 19 districts in the group of the highest incidence of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in
  the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many small
  outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  and community facilities, kindergartens and schools, various occupational settings and in the context of
  religious gatherings continue to contribute to the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person,
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days, This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value, After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards, In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards, They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable,
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3,
                          4-day R-value                                                               7-day R-value
                                 0.88                                                                       0.99
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.74 – 1.06)                                      (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.91 – 1.06)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value, The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value,

  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 19/11/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 15/11/2020).
  The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past few days the R-value has
  been fluctuating and is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-
  CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this
  means that there is still a high number of new cases every day.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 19/11/2020, a total of 1,288 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,207
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,934 (78%) are occupied, and 6,273 (22%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 46, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased
     further. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further
     information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 46, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) decreased, but remained on a level comparable to that of previous seasons. The ARI rate declined
     in all age groups. The ARI rate had to be corrected downwards for week 46, 2020 and the previous weeks
     retrospectively, as additional diagnosis codes had been wrongly included since week 40, 2020. Within
     the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 17 of 67 sentinel samples (25%) in
     week 46, 2020. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 14 samples (44%) and SARS-CoV-2 was found
     in 4 samples (6%). No influenza virus was detected. Further information can be found under
     https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 45, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased slightly. The
     number of SARI cases in the age group 35 to 59 years continued to increase to a high level, comparable
     to the peak level of previous influenza seasons. In contrast, the number of SARI cases in children aged 0

    to 14 years remained below the usual level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 45, 2020, 53% were
    diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (See Figure 4). The proportion of COVID-19 infections
    among SARI cases has increased since week 40, 2020 and has reached a new peak in week 45, 2020. The
    proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age groups can be found in Table 4. The proportions of
    COVID-19 cases in age groups 35 to 59 years and 60 years and above were slightly higher in autumn
    (weeks 40 to 44, 2020) than in spring (week 12 to 20, 2020). In SARI cases aged between 15 to 34 years,
    the proportion of COVID-19 cases in autumn has been nearly twice as high as in spring. In week 45, 2020,
    the proportion of COVID-19 cases was exceptionally high in the age groups above 14 years, comprising at
    least half of the SARI cases in this week. This proportion is highest in SARI cases aged between 35 to 59
    years at 74%. Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the
    main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.
