       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. An overview of the
       weekly schedule of topics is available at: www.rki.de/covid-19-en

       Summary (as of 23/02/2021, 12:00 AM)
       • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the
           health of the general population to be very high.
       • Yesterday, 3,883 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 415 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
           transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 60 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence in Bremen and Saxony is
           moderately, in Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt considerably above the national incidence.
       • In 238 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 47 districts, the 7-day
           incidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in 3 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
       • The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 46 and among the age group ≥80 years 74 cases/100,000
           population.
       • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
           households, occupational settings as well as nursing and long-term care homes.
       • On 23/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 3,037 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +385 existing patients had
           been discharged (27% of whom had died) and +362 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
           treatment was -23 more than the prior day.
       • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 3,413,730 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 4.1%) and of
           those und 1,806,606 people twice (vaccination rate 2.2%) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
       • In this situation report, the following additional information is given: demographic distribution of cases, clinical aspects, possible
           countries of exposure, and outbreaks.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 23/02/2021

  •
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI classifies all cases of laboratory
  confirmation via SARS-CoV-2-nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) detection or SARS-CoV-2 isolation as COVID-19
  cases, regardless of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, in the following report the term
  "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  The decrease in the daily number of cases since mid-January 2021 is currently not continuing.
  The 7-day R-value is currently around 1 – recently with an upward trend. Due to the occurrence of different
  virus variants (see below) there is an increased risk of a renewed increase in the number of cases.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number
  of serious cases and deaths remains at a high level. These can only be avoided if all persons prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by correctly wearing a surgical mask or FFP2 mask (or N95 or KN95 respectively).
  Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide. Since mid-December 2020 there
  have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United Kingdom. There is
  increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased infectiousness of this variant.
  Additionally, there are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with variant B.1.1.7 may
  lead to more severe diseases. Moreover, in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2
  variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased
  infectiousness is conceivable. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that the efficacy of the licensed mRNA
  vaccines is apparently not substantially affected by the variants B.1.1.7. and B.1.351. Additionally, a SARS-
  CoV-2 variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Non-essential
  travel should be avoided – especially due to the circulation of variants of concern.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection process is
  increasingly monitored through integrated molecular surveillance.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,394,811
  (+3,883) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,197,421 cases (50%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (23/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Figure 2: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=2,392,116) cases with respective data in
  the weeks 10 to 53, 2020 and weeks 01-07, 2021 (23/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  After the first wave until reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence remained low and has
  increased steadily starting in younger age-groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups.
  Until the end of 2020 an increase of the 7-day incidence could be seen in all age groups, especially in the
  age groups 80 years and older. Since reporting week 02, 2021 the incidence in all age groups has been
  decreasing. While this downward trend continues in the age groups 80 years and older, 7-day incidences in
  younger age groups are currently plateauing or slightly increasing again.

  Figure 3 displays the total number of cases as well as percentages of deceased, hospitalized and
  symptomatic cases (COVID-19 relevant symptoms). The percentage of cases with COVID-19 relevant
  symptoms has been above 80% since week 38, 2020. During the summer (weeks 26-36, 2020) these
  proportions were between 65% and 77%. During that time period returning travelers were increasingly
  tested, among whom asymptomatic infections were detected more frequently. The proportion of
  hospitalized COVID-19 cases increased from 5% in week 35 and has been around 10% since week 49, 2020

  (with a maximum of 12% in week 53, 2020). The percentage of deaths among cases was less than 1%
  between week 30 and 41, 2020. An increasing trend is visible from week 36 onwards. In weeks 47-53, the
  proportion of deaths was between 2.4 and 4.2 % and has been decreasing steadily since the beginning of
  the new year. As deaths occur on average 2-3 weeks after infection, further reports of deaths are expected
  for weeks 04 – 06/2021. The data on which the figure is based and that were published here on previous
  Tuesdays can be found at: www.rki.de/covid-19-tabelle-klinische-aspekte
  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 deaths according to week of death for the reporting weeks 10 – 53, 2020 and weeks 01-07,
  2021 (23/02/2021, 12:00 AM). The grey area indicates that additional notifications are expected for this time period.
  The figures on the first page show the number of deaths reported daily according to date of entry at RKI. This
  may also include cases with a date of death several days in the past. Figure 4 shows the reported COVID-19
  deaths by calendar week according to the date of death. For recent weeks, further reports of deaths among
  reported cases can be expected.
  A significant increase in the number of deaths was observed since week 37. Since week 53, the number of
  reported deaths is decreasing considerably. Of all deaths, 60,675 (89%) were among people aged 70 years or
  older, with a median age of 84 years (Table 3), while this age group accounts for only 16% of all cases. Thus
  far, 8 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. All of these deaths
  are validated; these children and adolescents were between 0 and 17 years of age, and eight of nine with
  information in this regard had known pre-existing conditions.

  Possible countries of exposure
  In weeks 04-07 2021, of the 246,226 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of
  exposure was missing in 119,064 (41%) cases.
  The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the summer vacation
  period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week.
  Since then, it has decreased to currently 300 cases in week 52, 2020. Since the Christmas holidays, the
  number of cases has initially gone up again, to 1,273 in week 02, and is now decreasing again, to 257 cases
  in MW 07, 2021. In the weeks 04-07 2021, a total of 1,269 persons (less than 1% of all reported cases)
  reported a possible site of infection abroad.
  Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
  quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (for further details
  see https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende).
  Outbreaks
  The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is known
  to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated
  incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After further case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, while values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently
  estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                                0.96                                                            0.98
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.85 – 1.11)                            (95%-prediction interval: 0.92 – 1.05)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    Figure 6: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of the estimated number of
    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 23/02/2021, 12 AM, considering cases up to 19/02/2021).
    The 7-day R-value is currently around 1. However, due to the occurrence of different virus variants there is
    an increased risk of a renewed increase in the number of cases.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under http://www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 23/02/2021, a total of 1,280 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,881 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 22,302 (83%) are occupied, and 4,579 (17%) beds are currently available.
     The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
     population to be very high. The revised version highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-
     CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in nursing and senior care homes, households, and
     occupational settings.
     Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
     rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
     outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
     vulnerable persons.
     On 12/02/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
     current version can be found here: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

 Annex
    1
      The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
      transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
    2
      Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
      number of recovered cases.
    3
      The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
      hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
    4
      Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
      reported.
