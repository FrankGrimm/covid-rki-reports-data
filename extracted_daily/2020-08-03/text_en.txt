*Change compared to previous day: due to a incorrect cancellation within the electronic system and transmission of this cancellation to the RKI, 139
cases of illness and 6 deaths were erroneously removed from the calculation yesterday. This cancellation was corrected today and the cases were added.
**Estimate
 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
 German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
 health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
 data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

         Summary (as of 03/08/2020 12:00 AM)
               In the past few weeks, the number of districts that have not reported any COVID-19 cases over a
                period of 7 days has decreased clearly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal
                states. This trend is concerning.
               The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 5.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
                and thus further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 78 districts transmitted zero
                cases over the past 7 days. Moreover, in 214 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000
                inhabitants.
               In total, 210,402 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,148 deaths due to COVID-19 have
                been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
               In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >150
                cases among harvest workers of two agricultural companies.
               Moreover, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including nursing homes and
                hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, as well as in context of religious or family
                events.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      An increase in COVID-19 case numbers since last week occurred in many of the federal states.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case outbreaks in different administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and
      health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning
      from travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since last week. This development is very
      concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also in outdoor
      settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where necessary, wearing a community or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 210,402
      (+509) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see

  Table 1). A total of 78 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks, the number
  of districts that have not submitted any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased
  continuously; on 12th July still, the number of districts reporting zero cases was 125.

  As part of quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices, corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports) can occiasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  * Due to a incorrect cancellation within the electronic system and transmission of this cancellation to the RKI, 139 cases of illness and 6 deaths
  were erroneously removed from the calculation yesterday. This cancellation was corrected today and the cases were added.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 65,533 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 6,191 were children under 10 years of age (2.9%), 11,155 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.3%), 93,970 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 62,099 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (30%), 31,064 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,464 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.6%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 459 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48
  years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 178.654 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
  cough (47%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,268 cases (3.0%). Since
  calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,

  ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
  reported in 5,176 of 34,631 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,734 (17%) of 183,122 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 193,500 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  In total, 9,148 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.4% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,058 (55%) are men and 4,085 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
  five cases.
  The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,820 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only
  18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of
  age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases. Since
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases, the
  proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Four districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts of
  Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, district Offenbach in Hesse, the district Dithmarschen in Schleswig-
  Holstein and the district Kleve in North Rhine-Westphalia.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to an outbreak among harvest workers of an agricultural
  company. Among more than 450 employees, >230 SARS-CoV-2-infections were identified. Quarantine
  was ordered for the entire company. The local population (3,300 inhabitants) has been offered
  voluntary testing.

  Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.
  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 03/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 30/07/2020).
  A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
  estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
  This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
  outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
  affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
  relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
  The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.09 (95%-prediction interval: 0,84 – 1.32) and is based on
  electronically notified cases as of 03/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
  Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
  compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
  of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.00 (95% prediction
  interval: 0,88 – 1.11) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 03/08/2020, 12:00 AM.

     The reported 7-day R value has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a
     larger number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

  DIVI intensive care register
     A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
     RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
     number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     As of 03/08/2020, a total of 1,275 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 33.029 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 20,785 (63%) are occupied, and 12.244 beds (37%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number
     of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or
     increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks).
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
       care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
       large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
       system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
