COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 29/07/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    In the past few weeks, the number of districts that have not reported any COVID-19 cases over a
          period of 7 days has decreased clearly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal
          states. This trend is concerning.
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 4.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 96 districts transmitted zero
          cases over the past 7 days. Moreover, in 212 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000
          inhabitants.
     •    In total, 206,926 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,128 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >150
          cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company. The entire company with over 450
          employees is under quarantine.
     •    Moreover, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including nursing homes and
          hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, as well as in context of religious or family
          events.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      An increase in COVID-19 case numbers since last week occurred in many of the federal states, but was
      most marked in Bavaria and Northrhine Wetphalia.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case outbreaks in different administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and
      health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning
      from travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since last week. This development is very
      concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also in outdoor
      settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where necessary, wearing a community or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 206,926
      (+684) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 96 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts that have not submitted any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has
      decreased continuously; on 12th July still, the number of districts reporting zero cases was 125.
      Figure 1: Number and cumulative incidence (per 100,000 population) of the 206,926 electronically reported COVID-19 cases in
      Germany by county and federal state (27/07/20220, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
      information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 63,785 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (29/07/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 5,942 were children under 10 years of age (2.9%), 10,708 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.2%), 92,069 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 61,471 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (30%), 30,867 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,432 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.6%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 437 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48
  years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 176,038 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
  cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,233 cases (3.0%). Since
  calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
  ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
  reported in 4,795 of 32,129 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,491 (17%) of 180,285 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 191,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  In total, 9,128 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.4% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,048 (55%) are men and 4,075 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
  five cases.
  The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,802 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only
  18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of
  age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases. Since
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases, the
  proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Three districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts
  of Dingolfing-Landau and Hof in Bavaria and the district of Weimar in Thuringia.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to an outbreak among harvest workers of an agricultural
  company. Among more than 450 employees, >150 SARS-CoV-2-infections were identified. Quarantine
  was ordered for the entire company. The local population (3,300 inhabitants) has been offered
  voluntary testing.

    A high 7-day incidence with more than 35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
    Hof (Bavaria). Several events are responsible for this increase. An outbreak in a large family has
    extended to several families in neighbouring communities. Another outbreak is related to a family event
    including individuals from Hof district as well as Weimar district in Thuringia. Together with another
    family-related outbreak, this explains the currently increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases per 100.000
    inhabitants in Weimar district. Due to ongoing screening activites, further cases can be expected.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 29/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 25/07/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.14 (95%-prediction interval: 0,92 – 1.36) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 29/07/2020, 12:00 AM.

     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.13 (95% prediction
     interval: 1,01 – 1.26) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 29/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported 7-day R value has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a
     larger number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.
     See also the RKI’s statement on high case numbers of 24/07/2020

     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
     R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can

  DIVI intensive care register
     A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
     RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
     number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     As of 29/07/2020, a total of 1,280 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 33,220 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 21,765 (66%) are occupied, and 11,455 beds (35%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
     well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
     are transmitted via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses
     (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the
     Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory
     medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 30/2020, 8.006.135 laboratory tests
     have been recorded to date, 243.590 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
     Up to and including week 30, 234 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
     one of the other transmitting networks and communicate mainly on a weekly basis. Since laboratories
     can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the numbers
     determined will increase subsequently. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as
     the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients (see Table 5).

      COVID-19 Situation Report 29/07/2020
10
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases declined from mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers
       have been steadily increasing. Some districts are transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However,
       reports of outbreaks in various settings are increasing again. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the
       health of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may
       change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
