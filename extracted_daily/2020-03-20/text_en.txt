      Further information
      The 31 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 20 men and 11 women from
      the 6 federal states: Bavaria (12), Baden-Wurttemberg (10), Northrhine-Westfalia (6), Hesse (1), Rhineland-
      Palatinate (1) and Schleswig-Holstein (1). All the deceased were older than 65 years of age; the mean age was 81
      years and median age 83 years.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as high. However, this risk varies from region to region.
      The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The
      burden on the health care system depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and
      initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some
      regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     The following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:

            restaurants, bars and clubs, as well as school and daycare closures starting the week of 16/03/2020.
