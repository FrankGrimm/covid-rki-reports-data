    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown in 59,248 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2. The
  incidence of COVID-19 decreased from reporting week 26 to 27 in the majority of states. In states with
  increases, overall incidences reamain low.

    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 168,563 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,089 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,727 of 25,164 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,554 (17%) of 172,009 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 183,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,036 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,995 (55%) are men and 4,036 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,736 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among Persons cared for or employed in medical and other
    care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
    persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
    female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
    among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
    reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in one district,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia).
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
    processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
    for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant remains temporarily closed and all employees are in quarantine
    together with their household members. The first employees were discharged from quarantine 14 days
    after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 hours after resolution of symptoms.
    In the district of Dingolfing-Landau, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among residents and staff in a shared
    accommodation for asylum seekers.

      In the district of Germersheim, an increase in COVID-19 cases was observed in connection with a
      religious community.
      A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
      well as religious communities.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

      Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 08/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 04/07/2020).
      A sensitive R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
      estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
      This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
      outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
      possibly exposed persons, leading to therapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases.
      This can lead to relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the
      case in Germany - the total number of new cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is
      0.70 (95%-prediction interval: 0.58 – 0.84) and is based on electronically notified cases as of
      08/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection

      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.83 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.77 – 0.91) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 08/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 07/07/2020, a total of 1,271 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,379
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,081 (65%) are occupied, and 11,298 beds (35%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
      differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
      discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
      well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
      are transmitted via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses
      (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the
      Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory
      medicine.
      Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 26/2020, 6,376,054 laboratory tests
      have been recorded to date, 232,261 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (see Table 5).

       Up to and including week 27, 228 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
       one of the other transmitting networks and communicate mainly on a weekly basis.
       Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
       the numbers determined will increase subsequently. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
       the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.

      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
      capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
      burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
