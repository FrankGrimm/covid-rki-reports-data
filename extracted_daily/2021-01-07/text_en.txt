      The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.

      Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3
      The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
      data were not recorded regularly.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

      Summary (as of 07/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general
           population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 26,391 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1.070 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the
           RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 122 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national
           incidence.
      • 410 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 241 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 25 districts
           have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 97 and of people ≥80 years 237 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and
           nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 07/01/2021 5,491 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 845 existing patients were discharged (24 % of
           whom had died) and 767 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 78 less than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 417,060 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (5,0 vaccinated per 1,000 population)
           (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
      • Testing and notification activities may have been lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete picture of the
           epidemiological situation in Germany of the previous two weeks.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 07/01/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
      detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
      following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
      19 disease.
      General current assessment
      Since the beginning of December, there has been a renewed sharp rise in the number of cases. During the
      holidays, the number of cases decreased. Whether the number of infections is actually declining will only
      become clear in the course of the next few days.
      The R-value is currently below 1. However, due to the still very high number of infected persons in
      Germany, this still means a high number of new infections per day. Due to the recent holidays, there may
      still be a delay in the detection, recording and transmission of COVID-19 cases, so that the R-value may also
      be underestimated.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
      and long-term care homes and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
      Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
      serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.
      On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. To date, it is unknown how the new
      virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been detected in
      numerous countries around the world. So far, a few cases of this new variant have been transmitted to the
      RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new virus variant detected in South
      Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility and more severe disease.
      Due to the holidays, it should be noted when interpreting the case numbers that, on the one hand, fewer
      people usually visited a doctor, as a result of which fewer samples were taken and fewer laboratory tests
      were performed. This may lead to fewer notified cases at the local level and hence to fewer transmitted
      COVID-19 cases to the RKI. Furthermore, not all local and state health authorities transmit data to the RKI
      on all days.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,835,038
  (+26,391) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases were detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,019,288 cases (56%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
  proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
  among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported in 410 from 412 districts.
  There are 25 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is known to be the cause of the
  high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated incidence, for example
  outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                0.77                                                            0.92
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.66 – 0.89)                            (95%-prediction interval: 0.85 – 1.01)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value. During the festive season COVID-19 cases were detected, notified and
  transmitted with delays, thus the R-value may be under-estimated.

  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases were detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  The R-value is currently below 1. However, due to the still very high number of infected persons in
  Germany, this still means a high number of new infections per day. Due to the recent holidays, there may
  still be a delay in the detection, recording and transmission of COVID-19 cases, so that the R-value may also
  be underestimated.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 07/01/2021, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,940
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,462 (83%) are occupied, and 4,478 (17%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In weeks 52 and 53, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased
     for both children and adults. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36,
     2020. Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In weeks 52 and 53, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections
     (ARI rate) decreased. The ARI rate was on a level comparable to the previous turns of the year of previous
     seasons. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 32 of 111 sentinel
     samples (39%) in weeks 52 and 53, 2020. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 17 samples (15%) and
     SARS-CoV-2 was found in 15 samples (14%). Since week 40, 2020, SARS-COV-2 has been found in 101 (8%)
     of 1,319 samples. Influenza virus or Respiratory Syncitial Virus have been detected in none of the 1,325
     samples tested since week 40,2020. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.

    A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
    (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
    respiratory tract). In week 52, 2020, the total number of SARI cases decreased. The number of SARI cases in
    the age group 35 to 59 years remained on a high level, comparable to the level at the peak of previous
    influenza seasons. In contrast, the number of SARI cases aged 60 years or above has decreased from the
    very high level in weeks 50 and 51, 2020 to the usual seasonal level. The number of SARI cases in children
    aged 0 to 14 years has been below the usual level since week 40, 2020.
    Since week 45, 2020, more than half of the reported SARI cases per week have been diagnosed with COVID-
    19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). In weeks 51 and 52, 2020, the proportion of COVID-19 infections
    remained on a high level at 66% and 70%, respectively. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI
    by age groups can be found in Table 4. The proportions of COVID-19 cases in all age groups in the weeks 40
    to 51, 2020 have been more than twice as high as in spring (weeks 12 to 20, 2020). In week 52, 2020, the
    proportion of COVID-19 cases was exceptionally high in the age groups above 14 years, comprising at least
    70% of the SARI cases in this week. This proportion was highest in SARI cases aged between 35 to 59 years
    at 77%. Within the 72 sentinel hospitals, there were no COVID-19 cases among SARI patients below 15 years
    of age in week 52, 2020. Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI
    as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

    with the ESEG project partners
    (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/ESEG/ESEG_node.html), the RKI analyses
    emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
    https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
    Within the emergency department situation report of the 06 January 2021, data from 21 emergency
    departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 03 January 2021. In week 53-
    2020, 11,666 admissions were recorded; which was a +12.1% change compared to last week, and a -26.9%
    average change compared to the mean of the pre-pandemic year 2019 (see Figure 5).
    Figure 5: Relative deviation of admissions in each emergency department compared to its mean in 2019, from January 2019 to
    January 2021 (as of 06 January 2021), averaged over all emergency departments.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
       population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
       as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households. occupational settings and nursing and
       senior care homes.
       Therefore. more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
       is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
       substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
