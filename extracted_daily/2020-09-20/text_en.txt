COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. Since 14/09/2020 the
RKI situation report will be published in a shortened version. The report will be more focused on the current situation. Demographic and clinical
aspects, for which there are only few daily changes, will be presented once a week and in a weekly comparison. Further data is also available in
the COVID 19 dashboard: https://corona.rki.de

 Summary (as of 20/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, further increase is currently
       observed in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must still be carefully monitored.
      The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 12.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The
       7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 3 districts: the city of Würzburg, the district
       Cloppenburg and the city of Munich. A total of 10 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
      In Bavaria and Berlin the 7-day incidence is considerably higher, in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hamburg
       and North Rhine-Westphalia noticeably higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
      In total, 271,415 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,386 deaths associated with COVID-19
       have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
      Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing homes
       and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
       settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 20/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory confirmations
    of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
    following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19
    disease.
    General current assessment
    After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, further increase is currently observed in the
    population of Germany. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly
    increasing, while the proportion of cases among travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The R-
    value is currently slightly above 1.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different situations,
    including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends or, especially in cases among younger people,
    outbreaks originating from travel returnees.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The number of deaths among reported COVID-
    19 cases is currently low. This is mainly due to the relatively high proportion of younger people among newly
    diagnosed cases in the last weeks, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. If the trend continues and
    more elderly and vulnerable people get infected, an increase in hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by consistently
    observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and, where necessary,
    by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided if possible
    and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 271,415 (+1,345)
  laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the RKI (Table
  1). A total of 10 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days, while on 16/06/2020 the number of districts
  reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

      Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
      transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
      *Yesterday no data was transmitted from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
      Distribution of cases over time
      The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
      transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
      symptoms is unknown for 99,306 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (20/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in
  26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here
  should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned
  facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The high
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  In 35 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including the
  district Cloppenburg and the cities of Würzburg and Munich where the 7-day incidence is > 50
  cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the district of Cloppenburg can be attributed to several COVID-19 clusters after
  outbreaks in sport clubs, families, nurseries, und religious communities. Responsible authorities
  implemented extensive regional measures, e.g. (partly) closings of schools and sport clubs, restaurants and
  event locations. Furthermore, serial testing of affected facilities was performed.
  The increased incidence in the city of Würzburg can be attributed to COVID-19 cluster after an outbreak in a
  shisha bar and further cases in private (bar visit) or work environments. A general ruling was published for
  the city which provides for restrictions on private events (max. 50 persons indoors, max. 100 persons
  outdoors) and prohibits the serving of alcohol from 11 p.m. to 6.00 a.m.
  The city of Munich has newly reached the 7-day incidence > 50 cases/100,000 population. Currently the
  situation is assessed and measures for restrictions on private events or serving of alcohol are discussed.
  The increased incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to transmission during family and other
  private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing.
  An increase in COVID-19-related outbreaks is reported in nursing homes; hospitals, facilities for asylum
  seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious
  events are continuously reported.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. R
  can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly extracted
  from the notification system.
                         4-day R-value                                      7-day R-value
                               1.22                                              1.17
        (95%-prediction interval: 0.99 - 1.48)                  (95%-prediction interval: 1.03 – 1.31)

      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for cases
      without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset electronically
      reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 20/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 16/09/2020).
      The reported R values were below or around 1 since mid-August and are above 1 since the second week of
      September. The increased R-values can be attributed increasingly to transmissions within Germany.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a dynamic
      and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase worldwide.
      The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the beginning of July,
      since then the number of cases has increased markedly. Many of these cases were associated with
      travellers. Since calendar week 35 transmissions within Germany can be observed to a larger extent. Large
      and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with celebrations
      with family and friends and at group events. There are still no approved vaccines and the treatment of
      severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
      The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
      very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.

   Infection risk
   SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on the
   regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene measures
   and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact) play a special
   role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In indoor rooms, this
   significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m is maintained. If the
   minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained, e.g. when groups of
   people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of transmission outdoors.
   Disease severity
   In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
   increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
   individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known previous
   illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening. Long-term
   consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
   Burden on health system
   The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the main
   population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation,
   quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase
   locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
