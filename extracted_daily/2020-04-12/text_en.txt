2    COVID-19 Situation Report 12/04/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 120,479 (+2,821) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 2,673 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). Delays in cases reporting and data transmission may occur over the Easter Holiday.
      In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states. Information on confirmed
      cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and
      https://corona.rki.de

    Germany by county and federal state (12/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health
    authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 45,288 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 49% are male and 51% are female. Among notified cases, 947 were children under 5
    years of age, 2,362 children aged 5 to 14 years, 82,461 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 23,340 persons aged
    60 to 79 years and 11,165 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 204 notified cases is
    unknown. The median age of cases is 50 years.

    information available (12/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 92,361 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are
    cough (51%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 2,180 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 14,129 (15%) of 92,098 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 60,300 persons are estimated to have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. As the
    exact date of recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of
    recovered cases.
    The 2,673 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 1,592 (60%) men and 1,076 (40%)
    women (sex was unknown in 5 cases, age was unknown in 2 cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all
    deaths, 2,304 (86%) were in persons 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group.
    Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the
    number of deaths is relatively high.
                                                               Age groups (years)

    SARS-CoV-2 infections among staff working in medical facilities
    Of notified cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least 5,500 were reported among staff working in
    medical facilities as defined by §23 of the German Protection Against Infection law (IfSG), such as
    hospitals, outpatient clinics and practices, dialysis clinics or outpatient nursing services. Among these
    5,500 persons 72% were female and 28% male. The median age was 42 years.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R0, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R0 can only be estimated
    and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R= 1.3 (95% confidence
    interval: 1.0-1.6) and is based on electronically notified cases (10/04/2020 12:00 AM) and an assumed
    mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were excluded from
    the estimation as their low number due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable estimate. For
    more details on the methodology see Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 Online vorab: 9. April 2020

    DIVI intensive care register1
    A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
    RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was set up to document the capacities for intensive care
    as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals:
    https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister .
    As of 12/04/2020, 752 hospitals or departments reported to DIV I (-2 since 10/04/2020) to the registry.
    Migration of the registry to a new server has led to reporting delays, thus comparisons with data prior to
    03/04/2020 are not meaningful. Currently, likely fewer than half of all ICU beds in Germany are captured
    by the registry. A total of 19,701 intensive care beds were registered, of which 11,376 (58%) are occupied
    and 8,325 beds are currently available (Table 3).

6    COVID-19 Situation Report 12/04/2020
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    International risk areas
      As of 10/04/2020 countries and regions are not longer classified as international risk areas. Due to
      pandemic spread, there is a global risk of acquiring COVID-19. In a considerable number of countries
      there are outbreaks with sometimes large numbers of cases; the exact numbers of cases in other
      countries are not known. Therefore there is a risk of transmission in Germany as well as in many other,
      not always well-defined regions worldwide.
      All arriving travellers in Germany are to remain in quarantine for 14 days:
      https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/neue-einreiseregeln-1739634 (in
      German)
    Other measures
      -     Outbreaks are ongoing in many districts, some with high case numbers. Data on current disease
            activity can be found on the dashboard https://corona.rki.de/ and in the daily situation reports.
      -     RKI teams are currently supporting outbreak containment measures with a focus on outbreaks in
            retirement and health care homes as well as hospitals in several federal states.
      -     A new federal law was implemented on 28/03/2020 for the protection of the public in the event of
            epidemic situations, granting the federal government additional competencies for the control of
            epidemics. https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2020/1-
            quartal/corona-gesetzespaket-im-bundesrat.html (in German)
      -     As of 23/03/2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and household
            members) are banned in all federal states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with body care
            were closed. In public spaces, all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to other indivduals
