COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
– Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
Summary (as of 09/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
• Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
    strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
• The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 139 cases per 100,000 population.
• Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
    incidence of people ≥ 60 years has further increased to currently 94 cases/100.000 population.
• The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony is higher than the national total
    7-day incidence.
• Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 7 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
    today, 42 districts have an incidence of >25-50 cases /100,000 population, 97 districts have an incidence of >50-100
    cases/100,000 population, 266 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 15 districts have
    an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
• The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
    gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as
    in occupational settings or related to religious events.
• The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has almost tripled in the past 2 weeks from 1,362 patients on
    26/10/2020 to 3,005 patients on 09/11/2020.
• In total, 671,868 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11,352 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
    to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 09/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating around
      1. This means that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will infect on average one other person. As the
      number of infected persons is currently high in Germany, this means that the daily number of newly
      infected persons will remain high.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 671,868
  (+13,363*) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 345,196 cases (51%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (09/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 53% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 74% were female and 26% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (405 of 412). By now, in 266 urban and rural districts the incidence is above 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 15 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  97 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population and 42 districts have a 7-day
  incidence of > 25 – 50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse most of the times, with several cases clustering in the context
  of celebrations with family and friends, but increasingly as well in community facilities and retirement
  and nursing homes. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the affected districts. At the same time, many small outbreaks in hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers
  and refugees, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to
  contribute to the increase of incidence.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
      extracted from the notification system.
                              4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                    1.09                                                             0.98
             (95%-prediction interval: (0.90 – 1.28)                             (95%-prediction interval: 0.87 – 1.07)
      Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
      less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 09/11/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 05/11/2020).
      The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past few days the R-value has
      been fluctuating around 1.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
      As of 09/11/2020, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 29,351
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,970 (73%) are occupied, and 8,381 (28%) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
