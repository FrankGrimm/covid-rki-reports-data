  The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to the delay of data transmission, cases from previous days may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3
  The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data are not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 03/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
        encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Thuringia is higher than the national
        total 7-day incidence of 134 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 119 cases/100,000 population.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 12 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000
        population. In comparison, 273 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 24 districts have
        an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and two districts of >500-1000 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
        households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to
        religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • After the strong increase in the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care until mid-November (3,395 cases on
        15/11/2020), the increase has slowed somewhat, with 3,980 cases on 03/12/2020.
    • On 02/12/2020, 22,046 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 479 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
        been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 03/12/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. The increase has leveled off since
      the second week of November. In November, the reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1. This
      means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of
      infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every
      day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly
      in households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and
      educational settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2
      without traceable transmission chains.
      While the 7-day-incidence among younger age groups is stable or slightly decreasing, the incidence
      among older people is further increasing. As the latter more often have more severe illness due to
      COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These can be avoided if we prevent
      the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,106,789
  (+22,046) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 594,226 cases (54%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (03/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  As of 18/11/2020, the number and proportion of persons ≥ 60 years old are reported in each category.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (400 of 412). There are 24 districts incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and two districts with
  incidences >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person,
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                              7-day R-value
                                 0.83                                                                     0.94
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.71 – 0.99)                                      (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.87– 1.02)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 03/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 29/11/2020).
    The reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1 in November. This means that, on average, each
    person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently
    very high in Germany, this means that there is still a high number of new infections every day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 03/12/2020, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,513
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,286 (81%) are occupied, and 5,227 (19%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 48, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
     stable. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further
     information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 48, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) remained stable on a level comparable to that of previous seasons. Within the viral surveillance of
     the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 18 of 83 sentinel samples (22%) in week 48, 2020. Among
     those, rhinovirus was identified in 13 samples (16%) and SARS-CoV-2 was found in 5 samples (6%). No
     influenza virus was detected. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 47, 2020, the total number of SARI cases decreased slightly. The
     number of SARI cases in the age group 35 to 59 years remained on a high level, comparable to the peak
     level of previous influenza seasons. In contrast, the number of SARI cases in children aged 0 to 14 years

  remained below the usual level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 47, 2020, 58% were diagnosed with
  COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age
  groups can be found in Table 4. The proportions of COVID-19 cases in all age groups were markedly
  higher in autumn (weeks 40 to 46, 2020) than in spring (week 12 to 20, 2020). In week 47, 2020, the
  proportion of COVID-19 cases was exceptionally high in the age groups above 14 years, comprising more
  than half of the SARI cases in this week. This proportion was highest in SARI cases aged between 15 to 34
  years and between 35 to 59 years at 68% and 69%, respectively. The proportion of COVID-19 cases
  among SARI cases below 15 years of age was 3% in week 47, 2020. Please note that due to data
  availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration
  of up to one week were included in this analysis.

 Data on emergency department utilization
     In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
     and with the ESEG project partners
     (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/ESEG/ESEG_node.html), the RKI analyses
     emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
     https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
     Within the emergency department situation report of the 02 December 2020, data from 22 emergency
     departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 29 November 2020. In week
     48-2020, 11,817 admissions were recorded; which was a -5.5% change compared to last week, and a -
     28.8% average change compared to the mean of last year (see Figure 5).
     Figure 5: Relative deviation of admissions in each emergency department compared to its mean in 2019, from January 2019 to
     November 2020 (as of 02 December 2020), averaged over all emergency departments.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
     situation on 01/12/2020. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
     as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
     senior care homes. Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection
     of vulnerable groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new
     infections can be substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikobewertung,html (in German)
