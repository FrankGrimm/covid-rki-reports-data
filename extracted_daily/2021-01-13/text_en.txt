       The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.
    2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because
       such data were not recorded regularly.
    4 Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sunday, no updated figures are reported.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

       Summary (as of 13/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
       • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the
           general population as very high.
       • Yesterday, 19,600 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,060 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to
           the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 155 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the
           national incidence.
       • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 319 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
           54 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and two districts have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000
           population.
       • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 122 and of people ≥80 years 303 cases/100,000 population.
       • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,
           occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
       • On 13/01/2021, 5,185 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 666 existing patients had been discharged (32 %
           of whom had died) and 621 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 45 less than the prior day.
       • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 758,093 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (9.1 vaccinated per 1,000 population)
           (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 13/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of
  COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  Since the beginning of December, there has been a renewed sharp rise in the number of cases. During
  the holidays, the number of cases decreased. In the last few days, the number of cases has risen again.
  Whether this trend will continue, beyond the expected retesting and re-reporting, will only become clear
  in the course of the next few days.
  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this
  means a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in
  nursing and long-term care homes, occupational settings and households. Additionally, in many districts,
  there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
  especially indoors - should be avoided.
  On 19/12/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. To date, it is unknown how the
  new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been
  detected in numerous countries around the world. So far, a few cases of this new variant in Germany
  have been reported to the RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new
  virus variant detected in South Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility and more severe
  disease. Isolates of this lineage have also been identified sporadically in Germany.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,953,426
  (+19,600) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  * In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by
  the RKI.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 1,073,960 cases (55 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 1.

  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (13/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported in all 412 districts. There
  are 54 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days and there are two
  districts with an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard shows all affected
  districts (https://corona.rki.de).
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is
  known to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the
  elevated incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                  7-day R-value
                                0.82                                                            1.02
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.68 – 0.93)                          (95%-prediction interval: 0.94 – 1.09)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this
  means a high number of new infections per day.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 13/01/2021

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 13/01/2021, a total of 1,282 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,991
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,570 (84 %) are occupied, and 4,421 (16 %) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.
     Table 2: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (13/01/2021, 12:15 PM).
                                                                              Number of
                                                                                                   Change to previous day*

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well
     as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data
     are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
     survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
     Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
     the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 01/2021, 36,353,196 PCR-laboratory
     tests have been recorded to date, 2,022,775 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
     Up to and including week 01/2021, 258 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or
     in one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis.
     Since laboratories can register and correct the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is
     possible that the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number
     of tests is not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of
     individual patients (Table 3 with data for the last 10 weeks – complete data since beginning of testing
     are available at http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German)).
     As testing criteria were adapted to the current situation of limited testing capacities in face of high case
     numbers and to take into account the common cold season, from week 46 onwards the proportion of
     positive tests cannot be compared directly to former weeks (Adapted testing criteria:
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Teststrategie/Testkriterien_Herbst_W
     inter.html in German).

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
     population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2
     transmission as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and
     nursing and senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable
     groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections
     can be reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the
     new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:
