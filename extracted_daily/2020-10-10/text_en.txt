COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 10/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
   Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed.
     Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and
     control.
   The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 24.3 cases per 100,000 population.
   The 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse
     and Hamburg moderately higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
   The district Neukoelln in Berlin exceeded a 7-day incidence of 100 cases/100,000 population. The 7-
     day incidence was 50 to 100 cases/100,000 population in 22 districts. Altogether, in 109 districts it
     exceeded 25 cases/100,000 population.
   Since calendar week 36 the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again.
   A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
     clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
     and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
     settings, and among travellers.
   In total, 319,381 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,604 deaths associated with COVID-19
     have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 10/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The R-value has been predominantly higher than 1
      since the beginning of September. At present, an increase of the R-values could be observed.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can mainly be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 123.318 cases (39%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (10/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 27% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 109 districts,
  including 6 city districts in Berlin (Neukoelln, Mitte, Tempelhof-Schoeneberg, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg,
  Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Reinickendorf), cities of Offenbach, Rosenheim, Herne, Frankfurt am Main,
  Hamm, Delmenhorst, Bremen, Wuppertal, Hagen, Cologne, Memmingen and Remscheid and the
  districts of Cloppenburg, Wesermarsch, Esslingen, Recklinghausen, and Fuerstenfeldbruck with 7-day
  incidences of >50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin is due to more diffuse transmission. Stricter distancing
  rules and opening restrictions for restaurants, bars and shops will apply from 10/10/2020.
  In the city of Wuppertal cases are increasing since end of September. A private party among adolescents
  seems to play a major role with further transmissions in several schools.
  In the district of Cloppenburg 89 cases are related to an outbreak among workers of a slaughterhouse.
  Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to a diffuse transmission with cases among family and
  other private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of
  COVID-19-related outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and
  refugees, community facilities, schools and kindergarten, various occupational settings and in connection
  with religious events has increased.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
  extracted from the notification system.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 10/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 06/10/2020).
     The reported R values have been predominantly higher than 1 since the beginning of September. At
     present, an increase of the R-values can be observed.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
     23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 10/10/2020, a total of 1,281 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,266
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,461 (72%) are occupied, and 8,805 (29%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     epidemiologic situation on 07/10/2020. The current version can be found here: Risk assessment for
