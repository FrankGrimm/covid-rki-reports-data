  Quality checks and data cleaning by the local health departments and federal state health authorities can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

Figure 2 shows the course of the COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population transmitted to the RKI on the
last 7 days in each of the federal states and in all of Germany. The values for the 7-day incidence in the
federal states range from 147.1 per 100,000 population in Thuringia to 32.6 per 100,000 population in
Schleswig-Holstein.

4 COVID-19 situation report as of 19/10/2021
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting the daily updated R-value can be retrieved
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
    Annex:
    Notes on data collection and evaluation
    The data presented in this situation report represent a temporal snapshot. Information on individual
    cases can be obtained and added by the health authorities in the course of the disease. It is not possible
    to obtain complete data for all variables.
    If necessary, the local public health authorities collect additional information, evaluate reported cases
    and initiate the necessary infection control measures. In accordance with the Infection Protection Act,
    the data are transmitted electronically by the local public health authorities to the federal state health
    authority and from there to the RKI on the next working day at the latest. The data is updated at the RKI
    daily at 0:00 AM.
    Data entry and data transmission can lead to a time lag from the time the case is reported to the local
    public health authorities until publication by the RKI, so case numbers may deviate from those from
    other sources.
    For the calculation of the incidences, the data of the population statistics of the Federal Statistical Office
    from 31.12.2020 are used. The calculation of the 7-day incidence is based on the reporting date, i.e. the
    date on which the local public health authorities became aware of the case and recorded it
    electronically. For the 7-day incidence, the cases reported on the last 7 days are counted.
    On the other hand, the number of cases since the previous day, as shown in the situation report and
    dashboard, is tied to the date when the case is first published in the RKI's reporting. Thus, due to
    transmission delays, it may occur that cases with a reporting date more than 7 days ago are still included
    in the situation report. At the same time, the number of cases since the previous day also may contain
    cases that were subsequently deleted in data quality checks. Thus, the 7-day incidence cannot be readily
    calculated from these single-day incidences.
    Notes
    1    The number of cases since the previous day refers to the date of receipt at the RKI; due to the delay in
         transmission, cases from previous days may be included.
    2    The number of active cases results from the number of transmitted cases minus the deaths and the estimated
         number of recovered cases.
    3    The algorithm for estimating the number of people who have recovered assumes an average duration of
         illness from onset or hospitalization date on. The true length of symptomatic illness and/or sequelae are
         usually not available in the reporting system.
    4    The total number of persons vaccinated at least once includes persons who received initial vaccinations with :
         Comirnaty® (BioNTech/Pfizer), Spikevax® (Moderna), Vaxzevria® (AstraZeneca) or vaccination with Janssen®
         (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine.
    5    Fully vaccinated against COVID-19 means: two vaccine doses with Comirnaty® (BioNTech/Pfizer), Spikevax®
         (Moderna), Vaxzevria® (AstraZeneca) or one dose with Janssen® (Johnson & Johnson) or a single dose in the
         case of COVID-19 recovered patients.
