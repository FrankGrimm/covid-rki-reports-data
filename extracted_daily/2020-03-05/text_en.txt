    parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and other federal states have become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Several cases
    report a travel history to South Tyrol.
    In addition, exclusion diagnoses are carried out in several federal states. Current figures on confirmed cases are
    available on the RKI website at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html
    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 400 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 197 cases from 13 states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 197 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (05/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 118 are male (60%) and 79 female (40%). The age range is from 2 to 75 years, including 6
    children under the age of 5, 3 children aged 5-14 and 188 persons (9%) in the age groups 15 to 79 years (see
    Figure 2). The median age is 37 years.

4   COVID-19 Situation Report 05/03/2020
      Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 02/03/2020. In 81 cases, onset of symptoms is
      unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Currently, there are insufficient
      data available to finally assess severity of COVID-19. Severe and fatal courses occur in some cases. The import of
      additional individual cases in Germany can be expected. Further single individual transmission events and chains
      of infection within Germany as well as local infection occurrences are possible. Therefore the risk to the German
      general population due to COVID-19 from China is currently considered to be moderate. However, a global
      spread of the pathogen seems increasingly likely. This assessment may change in the short term as a result of
      new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas
      -     As of 05/03/2020, the following regions are classified as risk areas (www.rki.de/covid-19-risikogebiete):
