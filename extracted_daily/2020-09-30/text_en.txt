 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 30/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
      COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must still
      be carefully monitored.
  • The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 14.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
      The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2 districts: the cities of Hamm and
      Remscheid. In a further 39 districts, it exceeded 25 cases/100,000 inhabitants. A total of 8 districts
      transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg was considerably higher, in North Rhine-
      Westphalia noticeably higher and in Bavaria and Hesse slightly higher than the national mean 7-day
      incidence.
  • In total, 289,219 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,488 deaths associated with COVID-19
      have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
      clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
      and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
      settings, and among travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 30/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The 4-day R-value has been predominantly greater
      than 1 since the second week of September.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent some time after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can only be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
      where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
      be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 289,219
  (+1,798) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1). A total of 8 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a
  total of 139 districts reported zero cases.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 107,779 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (30/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  *for care according to § 33 IfSG only cases under 18 years of age are taken into account, as other information may be assumed to be incorrect.
  Due to changes in data registration, not all data entries for cases ascertained in the most recent version of the surveillance software could be
  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 41 districts,
  including the cities of Hamm and Remscheid with 7-day incidences of > 25 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to 180 cases in connection with a wedding.
  More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine (https://www.hamm.de/corona).
  Stricter distancing measures have been implemented in Hamm
  (https://www.hamm.de/aktuelles/weitere-corona-massnahmen-beschlossen).
  In the city of Remscheid the high incidence is primarily due to smaller outbreaks in day care centres and
  schools with spread to outside contacts. Stricter control measures have been implemented
  (https://remscheid.de/corona#chapter146380100000143530-1015_sp_main_iterate_1_0).
  The increased incidence in Dingolfing-Landau following a COVID-19 outbreak at an industrial company
  and associated logistic partners dropped to just under 50 cases/100,000 population today. Mass testing
  was implemented. The district administration has decreed the implementation of stricter control
  measures (https://www.landkreis-dingolfing-landau.de/media/3063/allgemeinverfuegung-ldl-

     COVID-19 Situation Report 30/09/2020

      Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to transmission at family and other private events. The
      proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-19-related
      outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community
      facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
      extracted from the notification system.
                             4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value

            (95%-prediction interval: 0.78 – 1.17)                               (95%-prediction interval: 0.91– 1.12)
      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 30/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 26/09/2020).
      The reported R values have been predominantly greater than 1 since the second week in September.
      Although the R values are slightly lower today, this development must continue to be monitored closely.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available
      at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020
      from 23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.

    As of 30/09/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,679
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,972 (72%) are occupied, and 8,707 (28%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account that the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number
    of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or
    increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    To assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
    clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
    survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
    Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
    the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 39/2020, 16,999,253 laboratory tests
    have been recorded to date, 328,566 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Up to and including week 39, 252 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
    one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the
    ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the
    same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
    (Table 4).

      Testing of travellers at German points of entry
      At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres
      have been established. Some of the laboratories attached to those test centres have voluntarily provided
      aggregated statistics on the number of tests. For week 39/2020, 58,833 tests were reported from these
      entry points, of which 409 were positive (0.7%). It is not possible to say to which extent these 58,833
      tests are included in those reported in Table 4.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
      epidemiologic situation on 18/09/2020. The current version can be found here: Risk assessment for
      COVID-19
