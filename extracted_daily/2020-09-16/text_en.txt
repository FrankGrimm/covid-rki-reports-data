 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. Since 14/09/2020 the
 RKI situation report will be published in a shortened version. The report will be more focused on the current situation. Demographic and clinical
 aspects, for which there are only few daily changes, will be presented once a week and in a weekly comparison. Further data is also available in
 the COVID 19 dashboard: https://corona.rki.de
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 16/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
  •     After a high increase between calendar week 29 and 34, the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence had
        stabilized in calendar weeks 35 and 36, but since calendar week 37, a slight increase can be
        observed. Therefore, the situation must still be carefully monitored.
  •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 11.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
        The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2 districts: the district of Garmisch-
        Partenkirchen and the Würzburg in Bavaria. A total of 9 districts transmitted zero cases over the
        past 7 days.
  •     In Bavaria, Hamburg and Berlin the 7-day incidence is considerably higher, in Baden-Wuerttemberg
        and North Rhine-Westphalia it is slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  •     In total, 263,663 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,368 deaths associated with COVID-19
        have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
  •     Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing
        homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various
        occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 16/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
    confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
    cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as
    cases of COVID-19 disease.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July had stabilized at a slightly higher level in
    calendar weeks 35 and 36, but since calendar week 37, a slight increase can be observed again. The R-value
    is currently around 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks more young people have become infected,
    thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different situations,
    including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends or, especially in cases among younger people,
    outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The proportion of COVID-19 cases among travel returnees has
    been decreasing since calendar week 34, while the absolute number of cases remains constant. This shows
    that people are increasingly being infected again within Germany.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the proportion of
    deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of younger people
    among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A renewed increase in
    new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a renewed increase
    among the elderly and vulnerable groups of the population, as was the case at the beginning of the
    pandemic. If more elderly and vulnerable people become infected again, a renewed increase in
    hospitalizations and deaths must be expected. Since last week there has been a slight increase in the
    number of cases in the higher age groups; this trend should be observed carefully.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 263,663
  (+1,901) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
  RKI (Table 1). A total of 9 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days, while on 16/06/2020 the number of
  districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

     each federal state electronically reported to RKI, Germany (16/09/2020, 12:00 AM). The number of new cases covers positive
     cases, which have been sent to the local health department at the same day, but also at previous days.

     Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
     transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
     Distribution of cases over time
     The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
     transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
     of symptoms is unknown for 95,203 cases (36%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (16/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
   missing in 25% of cases, the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
   reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
   above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
   facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 2).
   The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  In 24 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
  the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the urban district of Würzburg, in Bavaria where the
  incidence is > 50 cases/100,000 population. Most districts affected are in the federal state of Bavaria.
  The increased incidence in the city of Würzburg can be attributed to COVID-19 cluster after an outbreak
  in a shisha bar and further cases in private (bar visit) or work environments. On 10.09.2020, a general
  ruling was published for the city which provides for restrictions on private events (max. 50 persons
  indoors, max. 100 persons outdoors) and on the serving of alcohol on the Old Main Bridge (city center).
  A travel returnee contributed to the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen
  district. She had stayed in several locations despite symptoms and ordered quarantine.
  The increased incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to transmission during family and other
  private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing.
  An increase in COVID-19-related outbreaks is reported in nursing homes; hospitals, facilities for asylum
  seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious
  events are continuously reported.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
  extracted from the notification system.
                         4-day R-value                                                               7-day R-value

      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 16/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 11/09/2020).
      The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are below or
      around 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers,
     particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number of
     smaller outbreaks.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
      As of 15/09/2020, a total of 1,283 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,759
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,142 (72%) are occupied, and 8,617 (28%) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
    reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
    in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
    well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
    data are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test
    laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
    Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
    the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 37/2020, 14,557,136 laboratory tests
    have been recorded to date, 300,047 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Up to and including week 37, 252 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
    one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the
    ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the
    same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients (see
    Table 4).

      Testing of travellers at German points of entry
      At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres
      have been established. Some of the laboratories attached to those test centres have voluntarily provided
      aggregated statistics on the number of tests. For week 37/2020, 156,641 tests were reported from these
      entry points, of which 1,187 were positive (0.76%). It is not possible to say to which extent these 156,641
      tests are included in those reported in Table 4.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
      dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
      worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the

   beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week.
   Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with
   celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age
   groups, have also contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no
   approved vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
   The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
   very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
   Infection risk
   SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
   the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
   measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
   play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
   indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m is
   maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained,
   e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of
   transmission outdoors.
   Disease severity
   In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
   increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
   individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
   previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
   Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
   Burden on health system
   The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
   main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
   (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
   rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
