1 The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.

  The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
    COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
    Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
    situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 16/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged
        to commit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.
    • Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 180 cases per 100,000 population. In
        Saxony and Thuringia it is severely above the overall incidence.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of
        people ≥60 years is currently 171 cases/100,000 population.
    • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 1 district has an incidence of ≤25 cases/100,000 population.
        In comparison, 342 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 53 districts have an incidence of >250-
        500 cases/100,000 population and 8 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households
        and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious events. For a
        large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • With 4,836 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.
    • Yesterday, 27,728 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 952 new deaths
        associated with COVID-19.
    • RKI’s risk assessment was updated. RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population as very high.
    • From Saxony, the cases missing yesterday were subsequently reported and are reported cumulatively for the last two days. All key
        figures again represent the actual values.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 16/12/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well
      as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the rise in cases could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since 04/12/2020 case numbers have been sharply increasing again.
      The R-value is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2
      infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in
      a high number of new infections every day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly in
      households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and educational
      settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without
      traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, the 7-day incidence increases in all age groups, particularly in persons aged 80 or over. As the
      latter more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also
      increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection
      control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,379,238
  (+27,728) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 755,751 cases (55%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (16/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
  proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

5                                                                                                                                                                                       5
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
    according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
    persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was
    particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
    among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
    reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
    Outbreaks
    An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
    (411 of 412). There are 53 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 8 districts with an
    incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected
    districts.
    In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
    particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
    hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
    schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
    estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that shows
    the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
    days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
    R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
    and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
    week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
    events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
    course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                                        4-day R-value                                                                             7-day R-value
                                             0.88                                                                                      0.98
                             (95%-prediction interval: 0.74 – 1.04)                                                    (95%- prediction interval: 0.90 – 1.06)
    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
    affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
                                                                        Cases:                      Symptom onset reported

       Figure 3: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
       COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 16/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 12/12/2020).
       The R-value is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2
       infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in
       a high number of new infections every day.
       Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
       https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
       with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
       number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
       with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
       As of 16/12/020, a total of 1,290 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,081
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,535 (83%) are occupied, and 4,546 (17%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.

 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
     clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
     ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey,
     via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance
     established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a
     professional association of laboratory medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 50/2020, 31.974.158 PCR-laboratory
     tests have been recorded to date, 1.421.702 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
     Up to and including week 50, 257 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in one of
     the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
     laboratories can register and correct the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible
     that the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is
     not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
     (Table 4 with data for the last 10 weeks – complete data since beginning of testing are available at
     http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German)).
     As testing criteria were adapted to the current situation of limited testing capacities in face of high case
     numbers and to take into account the common cold season, from week 46 onwards the proportion of
     positive tests cannot be compared directly to former weeks (Adapted testing criteria:

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
     situation on 11/12/2020. The RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general population to be very
     high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as the
     occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and senior care homes.
