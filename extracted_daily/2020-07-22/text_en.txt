  information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 61,832 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

   and older (2.7%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 465 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48
   years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
   (Figure 3).

   cases with information available (22/07/2020,12:00 AM).
   Clinical aspects
   Information on symptoms is available for 172,848 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
   cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,182 cases (3.0%). Since
   calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
   ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
   reported in 4,318 of 29,135 cases (15%).
   Hospitalisation was reported for 30,162 (17%) of 176,812 COVID-19 cases with information on
   hospitalisation status.
   Approximately 188,600 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
   recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
   In total, 9,095 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.5% of all confirmed cases).
   Of these, 5,028 (55%) are men and 4,062 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
   five cases. The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,782 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
   older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
   under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
   all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
  the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
  female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
  among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
  reflects the low number of case in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases
  among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
    Vechta (Lower Saxony). An accumulation of COVID-19 cases was detected as a result of screening of
    >1,000 employees of a meat processing company. Neighbouring districts are also affected.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 22/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 18/07/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the case in
    Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.89 (95%-prediction interval: 0.73 – 1.08) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 22/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.01 (95% prediction
    interval: 0.93 – 1.12) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 22/07/2020, 12:00 AM.

  DIVI intensive care register
     A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
     RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
     number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     As of 22/07/2020, a total of 1,276 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
     32,781 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,522 (66%) are occupied, and 11,259 beds (34%)
     are currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in
     Table 4.

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
     well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
     are transmitted via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses
     (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the
     Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory
     medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 29/2020, 7,418,812 laboratory tests
     have been recorded to date, 238,694 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (see Table 5).

      Up to and including week 29, 229 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
      one of the other transmitting networks and communicate mainly on a weekly basis.
      Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
      the numbers determined will increase subsequently. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
      the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid-March. Currently, many districts are
      transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
      German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
      short notice based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
      behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses.

    Burden on health system
    The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
    capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
    burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
