Summary (as of 16/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    In total, 130,450 COVID-19 cases and 3,569 deaths due to COVID-19 have been
     electronically reported to the Robert Koch Institute in Germany.
    All 16 federal states are affected. The incidence (cases per 100,000) of COVID-19 is highest
     in Bavaria (269), Baden-Wuerttemberg (234), Saarland (222) and Hamburg (215).
    Most cases (68%) are between 15 and 59 years old; men (48%) and women (52%) are
     almost equally affected.
    86% of deaths, but only 18% of all cases, occurred in persons aged 70 years or older.
    COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes and hospitals continue to be reported. In
     some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively high.
    As of 10/04/2020, the RKI no longer classifies countries or regions as international risk
     areas.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 130,450 (+2,866) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 3,569 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and https://corona.rki.de.

    Germany by county and federal state (16/04/2020, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 47,681 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 48% are male and 52% are female. Among notified cases, 1,038 were children under 5
    years of age (1%), 2,566 children aged 5 to 14 years (2%), 88,317 persons aged 15 to 59 years (68%),
    25,188 persons aged 60 to 79 years (19%) and 13,109 persons aged 80 years and older (10%) (see Figure
    3). The age of 232 notified cases is unknown. The median age of cases is 50 years.

    information available (16/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 101,538 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are
    cough (51%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 2,509 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 16,318 (16%) of 101,269 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 77,000 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. As the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    The 3,569 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 2,074 (58%) men and 1,490 (42%)
    women (sex was unknown in 5 cases, age was unknown in 2 cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all
    deaths, 3,079 (86%) were in persons 70 years or older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group.
    COVID-19 related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals. In some of these
    outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively high.

    SARS-CoV-2 infections among staff working in medical facilities
    So far, 6,395 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by §23 of the German Protection Against Infection law (IfSG), such as hospitals,
    outpatient clinics and practices, dialysis clinics or outpatient nursing services. The proportion of cases
    increased over time from at least 6% in Week 12, 8% in Week 13, 9% in Week 14 to 11% in Week 15,
    2020. Due to missing data on occupation in more than 40% of all cases, the true proportion of cases
    working in medical facilities may be higher. Among these cases, 72% were female and 28% male. The
    median age was 42 years. Hospitalisation was reported for 262 (4%) of 6,224 cases among staff working in
    medical facilities with information available. There were 8 COVID-19 related deaths among staff working
    in medical facilities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R can only be estimated
    and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R= 0.7 (95% confidence
    interval: 0.5-0.8) and is based on current electronically notified cases (16/04/2020, 12:00 A.M.) and an
    assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were
    excluded from the estimation as their low number due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable
    estimate. For more details on the methodology see Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 (in German)
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html
    Information from further surveillance systems for acute respiratory illnesses based at RKI
    GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
    (ARI) utilizing information from the population. In Week 15, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate” as well as the
    rate of influenza-like illness (”ILI-rate”) remained stable compared to the previous week. Further
    information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
    The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARE through a sentinel network of physicians in private
    practice. In Week 15, 2020 the number of patient visits declined yet again among patients of all age
    groups. The AGI broadened its viral surveillance to include SARS-CoV-2. Since Week 8, 2020, a total of 12
    SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were detected in 1,111 tested samples (1%) sent from a subsample of the
    sentinel physicians. The influenza season ended in Week 12, 2020; no influenza activity was detected in
    Week 15, 2020. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
    A third ICD 10 Code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
    (ICD-10-Codes J09 to J22: Primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
    airways). In Week 14, 2020, 31% of all reported cases were diagnosed with COVID-19 (Table 5), with no
    cases among children under 15 years of age and up to 44% among 35 to 59 year old patients. Please note
    that only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI in the main DRG diagnosis and a hospitalisation duration
    of up to one week were included in this analysis.

      DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was set up to document the capacities for intensive care
      as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals. The DIVI intensive care register
      shows, how many intensive care beds are available in which clinics on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020,
      reporting is compulsory for all hospital sites with intensive care places.
      As of 16/04/2020, 1,067 hospitals or departments reported to DIVI to the registry. A total of 26,628
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 15,316 (58%) are occupied and 11,312 beds are currently
      available (Table 3).

      meaningful. Currently, fewer than half of all ICU beds in Germany are likely captured by the registry. Source:

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
