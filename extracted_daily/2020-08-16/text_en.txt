COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 16/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly in many federal states and the
             number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased markedly.
             This trend is very concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 8.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and, thus, at an increased level. A total of only 27 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7
             days. In a further 180 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In North-Rhine Westphalia, Berlin and Hesse the 7-day incidences are markedly and in Hamburg
             just above the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 223,453 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,231 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, meat-processing plants
             and other occupational settings, educational settings and especially among travellers and in the
             context of religious events or events with family and friends.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 16/08/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. In the past two days, the trend in Covid-19 case numbers has declined slightly due to
      the testing and reporting delay over the weekend.
      Nationwide, there are a lot of reports of many smaller outbreaks in a number of administrative districts
      in various settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, educational and occupational settings,
      but also in community and health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified
      among travellers entering Germany. There is a risk that this multitude of events are going to accumulate
      to a substantial increase in the total number of cases.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and dynamics seem to increase. A further worsening of the situation must be
      avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to decreasing
      transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also in outdoor
      settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community or face mask correctly as
      well as by avoiding mass gatherings – especially in indoor areas – and limiting close contacts to
      immediate family and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 223,453
      (+625) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 27 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past
      few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
      decreased continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 72,944 cases (33%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (16/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Approximately 201,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,231 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.1% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,151 (55%) are men and 4,112 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in
  meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Seven districts reported an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the district
  of Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, the cities of Herne, Hagen, Duisburg and Wuppertal in Northrhine
  Westphalia, the cities of Berlin Mitte in Berlin and Offenbach in Hesse.
  In the district of Dingolfing-Landau the incidence increased due to two outbreaks with together close to
  500 COVID-19-cases, in two agricultural companies. Quarantine was ordered for all employees of both
  companies. No transmission into the local population has been detected thus far.
  In the cities of Herne, Hagen, Duisburg, Wuppertal, Berlin Mitte and Offenbach cases detected among
  travellers entering Germany as well as family clusters play an important role in the observed high 7-day
  incidence.

    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    educational settings, meat-processing plants and other occupational settings, in the context of family
    events and religious communities as well as among travellers.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 16/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 12/08/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.21 (95%-prediction interval: 0.97 – 1.44) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 16/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.13 (95% prediction
    interval: 1.00 – 1.26) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 16/08/2020, 12:00 AM.

      The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is associated with a
      larger number of outbreaks, but also with case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
      steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures and due to an increased number of travel
      returnees.
      See also the RKI’s statement on high case numbers of 24/07/2020
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Gestiegene_Fallzahlen.html
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020)
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
      mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
      transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
      again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
      available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
      as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks).
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
      care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
      large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
      system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
  Measures taken in Germany
