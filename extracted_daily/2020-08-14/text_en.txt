COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 14/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly in many federal states and the
             number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased markedly.
             This trend is very concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 7.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus further increased. A total of only 29 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
             In a further 192 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In North-Rhine Westphalia, Hamburg, Berlin and Hesse the 7-day incidences increased rapidly over
             the past few weeks and are markedly higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence. In
             Rhineland-Palatinate the value is just above the national mean.
        •    In total, 221,413 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,225 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau two COVID-19 related outbreaks occurred with almost
             500 cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company and among employees of a canning
             company.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, meat-processing plants
             and other occupational settings, educational settings and especially among travellers and in the
             context of religious or family events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 14/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states.
      Nationwide, there are a lot of reports of many smaller outbreaks in a number of administrative districts
      in various settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, educational and occupational settings,
      but also in community and health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified
      among travellers entering Germany. There is a risk that this multitude of events are going to accumulate
      to a substantial increase in the total number of cases.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and dynamics seem to increase. A further worsening of the situation must be
      avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to decreasing
      transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also in outdoor
      settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community or face mask correctly as
      well as by avoiding mass gatherings – especially in indoor areas – and reducing contacts to immediate
      family and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 221,413
      (+1,449) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 29 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past
      few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
      decreased continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.

   Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
   transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
   * Yesterday, Berlin transmitted no data to the Robert Koch – Institute.
   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
   onset of symptoms is unknown in 71,781 cases (32%), thus their date of reporting is provided in
   Figure 2.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (14/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 7,116 were children under 10 years of age (3.2%), 12,836 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.8%), 100,057 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 63,850 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (29%), 31,499 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,512 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.5%). The age and/or gender was unknown in 543 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 47
  years (median age 47 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (14/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 186,368 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (47%), fever (39%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,349
  cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance
  category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two
  symptoms was reported in 6,269 of 42,105 cases (15%).

   Hospitalisation was reported for 31,452 (16%) of 192,158 COVID-19 cases with information on
   hospitalisation status. Approximately 200,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection.
   Since the exact date of recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this
   number.
   A total of 9,225 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.2% of all confirmed cases).
   Of these, 5,111 (55%) are men and 4,110 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
   cases. The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,885 (85%)
   were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Thus far, three
   deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing
   medical conditions were reported for all three.

   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
   missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
   reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
   above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
   facilities is unknown.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in
  meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Eight districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, the city of Ludwigshafen in Rhineland-Palatinate, the city of Offenbach in
  Hesse, as well as the district of Unna and the cities of Herne, Hagen, Duisburg and Bochum in Northrhine
  Westphalia.
  In the district of Dingolfing-Landau the incidence increased due to two outbreaks with together close to
  500 COVID-19-cases, one among harvest workers of an agricultural company and the other –currently
  responsible for the continued high incidence - among employees in two of three locations of a canning
  company. Quarantine was ordered for all employees of both companies. The local population (3,300

    inhabitants) has been offered voluntary testing. No transmission into the local population has been
    detected thus far.
    In the cities of Offenbach, Herne, Duisburg, Ludwigshafen, Hagen and Bochum as well as the district of
    Unna, cases detected among travellers entering Germany play an important role in the observed high 7-
    day incidence.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    educational settings, meat-processing plants and other occupational settings, in the context of family
    events and religious communities as well as among travellers.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 14/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 10/08/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.08 (95%-prediction interval: 0.88 – 1.30) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 13/08/2020, 12:00 AM.

     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-
     day average of the nowcasting curve. This compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value
     represents a slightly later course of infection of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-
     value is estimated at 1.14 (95% prediction interval: 1.02 – 1.27) and is based on electronically notified
     cases as of 13/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is associated with a
     larger number of small outbreaks, but also with case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures and due to an increased number of travel
     returnees.

     number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     As of 14/08/2020, a total of 1,282 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,

   Mortality Monitoring
       A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
       excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
       the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
       (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data,
       have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
       monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
       An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
       April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also
       among those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the
       Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. All-cause mortality for the countries in the
       EuroMOMO network has now largely returned to expected levels.
       Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with
       a certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
       https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
       Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
       Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
       of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
       significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
       of May.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks).
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.

     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
