 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 04/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire
     population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 125.8 cases per 100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
     incidence of people ≥ 60 years has further increased to currently 82.4 cases/100.000 population.
 • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland is higher than the national
     total 7-day incidence.
 • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 7 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
     today, 130 districts have an incidence of >50-100 cases/100,000 population, 229 districts have an incidence of >100
     cases/100,000 population and of these, 32 districts have an incidence of >200 cases/100,000 population.
 • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
     gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as
     in occupational settings or related to religious events.
 • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has almost tripled in the past 2 weeks from 943 patients on
     21/10/2020 to 2,546 patients on 04/11/2020.
 • In total, 577,593 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,812 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
     to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 04/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has decreased and today is
      approximately 1. This means that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will infect on average one other
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently high in Germany, this means that the daily
      number of newly infected persons will remain high.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 577,593
  (+17,214) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 283,000 cases (49%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (04/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases.
   Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 49% of cases, the
   numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
   considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
   the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
   persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
   particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (405 of 412). By now, 229 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 32 districts with an incidence of over 200 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  130 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse most of the times, with several cases clustering in the context
  of celebrations with family and friends, but increasingly as well in community facilities and retirement
  and nursing homes. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the affected districts. At the same time, many small outbreaks in hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers
  and refugees, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to
  contribute to the increase of incidence.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
      extracted from the notification system.
                             4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                   0.81                                                             0.92
            (95%-prediction interval: (0.66 – 0.95)                              (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 – 1.00)
      Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
      less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 04/11/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 31/10/2020).
      The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past days the R-value has
      decreased slightly and is approximately 1 today.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
      As of 04/11/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,763
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,695 (75%) are occupied, and 7,068 (25%) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown inTable 3.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
    reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
    in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    To assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
    clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
    survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
    Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
    the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 44/2020, 23,393,311 laboratory tests
    have been recorded to date, 611,248 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Up to and including week 44, 253 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
    one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register and correct the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is
    possible that the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number
    of tests is not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of
    individual patients (Table 4 with data for the last 10 weeks – complete data since beginning of testing are
    available at www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German)).
