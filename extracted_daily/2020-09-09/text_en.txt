COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 09/09/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    After a high increase between calendar week 29 and 34, the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has slightly
             decreased in calendar week 35. Even if the number of new cases does not increase significantly at
             the moment, the situation must still be carefully monitored.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
             total of 28 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 141 districts the 7-day-
             incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen and Hesse the 7-day incidence is higher than the
             national mean 7-day incidence, in some of these federal states considerably so.
        •    In total, 253,474 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,338 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing
             homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various
             occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 09/09/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of the WHO 1 and the ECDC², the RKI evaluates all laboratory
    diagnostic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 cases, regardless of the presence or severity of the clinical
    symptoms. In the following report, "COVID-19 cases" thus includes both acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and
    cases of COVID-19 disease.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July has now stabilized at a slightly higher level. The
    R-value is currently around 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks more young people have become
    infected, thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
    situations, e.g. larger celebrations in the family and among friends. In addition, COVID-19 cases are
    identified to a large extent among travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the proportion of
    deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of younger people
    among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A renewed increase in
    new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a renewed increase
    among the elderly and vulnerable groups of the population, as was the case at the beginning of the
    pandemic. If more elderly and vulnerable people become infected again, a renewed increase in
    hospitalizations and deaths must be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 253,474
    (+1,176) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 28 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on
    16/06/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

   Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
   transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
   onset of symptoms is unknown for 89,899 cases (36%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 9,244 were children under 10 years of age (3.7%), 17,553 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.9%), 119,365 persons aged 20 to 49 years (47%), 68,463 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (27%), 32,461 persons aged 70 to 89 years (13%) and 5,600 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.2%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 788 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 45 years
  (median age 44 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).
  Figure 3: Electronically reported COVID-19 cases/100,000 population in Germany by age group and gender (n=252,680) for
  cases with information available (09/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 209,703 (83%) of the notified cases. For 13% of these cases it
  was reported that no symptoms relevant for COVID-19 were present. Among those, for whom
  symptoms were reported, cough (44%), fever (37%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%) were
  frequent. Pneumonia was reported in 5,540 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to
  the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be
  entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in 10,242 of 65,213 cases
  (16%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 32,875 (15%) of 218,602 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 228,000 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,338 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.7% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,176 (55%) are men and 4,158 (45%) are women (Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years).
  Of all deaths, 7,969 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 15% of all cases were in this
  age group. So far, two deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for both of them. The number of deaths may change
  after data validation is completed.

   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
   missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
   reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
   above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
   facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 3).
   The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.

    Outbreaks
    In 12 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
    the urban districts of Memmingen, Rosenheim and Landshut, where the incidence is > 50 cases /
    100,000 population. Most affected districts are in the federal state of Bavaria. The increased incidence
    in the affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but also to
    transmission during family and other private events.
    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
    asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
    religious events.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 09/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 05/09/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.88 (95%-prediction interval: 0.71 – 1.08) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 09/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection

      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.95 (95% prediction
     interval: 0.86 – 1.04) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 09/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are around 1 or
     below 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers,
     particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number
     of smaller outbreaks.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7-
      day R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values
      can also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
      As of 09/09/2020, a total of 1,283 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
      30,658 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,877 (71%) are occupied, and 8,781 (29%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
      reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
      in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
      well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
      data are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test
      laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based

  SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
  (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
  Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 36/2020, 13,436,301 laboratory
  tests have been recorded to date, 290,372 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
  Up to and including week 36, 252 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
  one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis.
  Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
  the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
  the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients

  Testing of travellers at German points of entry
  At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres
  have been established. Some of the laboratories attached to those test centres have voluntarily
  provided aggregated statistics on the number of tests. For week 36/2020, 193,899 tests were reported
  from these entry points, of which 2,021 were positive (1.04%). It is not possible to say to which extent
  these 161,105 tests are included in those reported in Table 5.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 09/09/2020

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
       dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
       worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
       beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week.
       Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with
       celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age
       groups, have also contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no
       approved vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
       The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
       very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
       play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
       indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
       is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
       maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
       risk of transmission outdoors.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
       individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
       previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
       Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
       main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
       (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
       rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
