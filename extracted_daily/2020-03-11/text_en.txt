2   COVID-19 Situation Report 11/03/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    Case numbers1
      With over 1,000 cases in Germany, the COVID-19 case numbers can no longer be manually updated and reported
      in a quality assured manner. Therefore, the reporting will be changed. As of today, epidemiological evaluations in
      the COVID-19 situation report will only refer to the electronically transmitted data that are available to the
      Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at the time of the data closure. The number of cases notified in advance manually will
      be listed in addition to the electronically reported cases until 13/03/2020 (see Table 1), after which only the
      electronically transmitted cases will be shown.
      A total of 1,567 (+271) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been detected
      in Germany since 27/01/2020, of which 1,089 were electronically reported to and validated at the RKI. So far, 3
      deaths related to COVID-19 diseases were reported.
      Information on laboratory-confirmed cases
      So far, 1,567 cases in 16 federal states have been laboratory-confirmed (Table 1).

    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 1,567 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 1,089 cases from 16 states have been electronically reported to
    the Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 1,089 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (11/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 595 are male (55%) and 494 female (45%). The age range is from 0 to 89 years, including 15
    children under the age of 5, 14 children aged 5-14 and 891 persons in the age groups 15 to 59 years and 142
    persons 60 years and older (see Figure 2). The age of 4 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 43 years.

    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 10/03/2020. In 517 cases, onset of symptoms
    is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

      alternatively by date of reporting (11/03/2020)
      Further information
      Since 09/03/2020, 3 people in Germany have died of COVID-19 disease. It concerns an 89-year-old woman from
      Essen and a 78-year-old man from the Heinsberg hospital. In addition, the authorities today reported a second
      death in the Heinsberg district. A male patient (73 years old) infected with SARS-CoV-2 died in a Heinsberg
      hospital. Further details are not yet known.
      In Cairo, another German tourist has died of a respiratory disease. He was not tested for SARS-CoV-2, but the
      accompanying wife tested positive. On 08/03/2020 a German tourist died for the first time of COVID-19 in Egypt.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as moderate. However, this risk varies from region to
      region and is higher in "particularly affected areas". The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The burden on the health care system depends on the regional
      distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social
      distancing etc.), and may be very high in some regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of
      new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
