    Hospitalisation was reported for 28,812 (18%) of 165,073 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 175,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    In total, 8,885 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.7% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,918 (55%) are men and 3,962 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,623 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 19% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    So far, 13,677 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence rate was observed in five districts, primarily due to localised outbreaks: The
    districts of Guetersloh and the neighbour district of Warendorf (both North Rhine-Westphalia), the
    district of Goettingen (Lower Saxony), and the cities of Magdeburg (Saxony Anhalt) and Neukölln (city
    district of Berlin).
    The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
    plant. More than one thousand employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was
    temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are being quarantined as well as their household
    members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the district have been closed since 18th of June
    until the end of the summer holidays (11th of August 2020s). The town of Verl, located in the affected
    district, has enforced a quarantine zone for those areas in which higher numbers of the processing
    plant’semployees are housed. The 7-day high incidence in Warendorf is linked to the outbreak in
    Guetersloh . Employees of the meat processing company are residents of neighbouring districts.
    A large COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the district of Goettingen related to family gatherings, for which
    a large number of contact persons has been identified. In Magdeburg, an outbreak affecting several now
    closed schools has led to an increase in the 7-day incidence.
    In Neukölln, a district of Berlin, an outbreak is linked to members of a religious community. So far 85
    cases are linked to this outbreak.
    Once again there were major outbreaks in retirement- and nursing homes. In the district of Verden
    residents and nursing staff have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Further outbreaks were reported among members of religious communities, eg. from Berlin, Hesse and
    and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
    analysis.

      Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for

      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 21/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 17/06/2020).
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 2.76 (95%-prediction interval: 2.10– 3.42) and
      is based on electronically notified cases as of 21/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.83 (95% predictation
      interval: 1.51 – 2.17) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 21/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      Estimates of the reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) were around the value of 2 during
      the last few days. This is mainly related to local outbreaks which are described above, the outbreak in
      North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role in this context . Since case numbers in
      Germany are generally low, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the
      reproduction number. Further developments need to be monitored closely during the upcoming days,
      especially in regard to whether case numbers are increasing outside of outbreak contexts.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  DIVI intensive care register
       A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
       RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
       number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
       hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       As of 22/06/2020, a total of 1,256 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,891
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 17,602(63%) are occupied, and 10,289 beds (37%) are
       currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
       differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
       discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
