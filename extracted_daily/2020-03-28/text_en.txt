    authority.
    Time course
    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 27/03/2020. In 19,873 cases, onset
    of symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

      Demographic distribution
      Among these cases, 25,814 are male (53%) and 22,595 female (47%). In total, 343 children under the
      age of 5, 971 children aged 5 to 14 years, 36,537 persons aged 15 to 59 years and 10,587 persons 60
      years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 144 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 48 years.

      data available; 28/03/2020, 12:00 AM)
      Clinical aspects
      Clinical information is available for 35,011 of the notified cases, of which 1,062 cases were reported as
      not having any symptoms considered significant for COVID-19. The most common manifestations are
      cough (18,768; 54%), fever (14,566; 42%), rhinorrhoea (8,065; 23%) and pneumonia (626; 2%).
      Hospitalisation was reported in 3,906 (11%) of the 35,346 COVID-19 cases with data available.
      An estimated 9,600 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases were considered to
      have recovered if they had a known onset of disease on or before 14/03/2020, were not reported to
      have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged and did
      not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of illness onset, symptoms,
      hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
      The 325 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 214 men and 110
      women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 100 years. Of all deaths, 283 (87%) were in
      persons 70 years or older (but only 10% of all cases). A 28 year old woman with severe underlying
      healt conditions died in Bavaria.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe
      and fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI
      currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high, but as very high for
      risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing
      previous illnesses. The risk varies from region to region. The burden on the health care system
      depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment

           emergencies with national concern. With this law the government (national level) will get
           additional competencies regarding different areas (e.g . in the area of public transport, securing
           provision of pharmaceuticals and medical products, as well as regarding ressources of the health
           sector) for combating an epidemic of national concern. Furthermore there will be a compensation
           arrangement for parents experiencing reduced income due to child care needs.
     -     The German Federal Ministry of the Interior proclaimed an entry ban for seasonal workers such as
           harvest workers as of 25 March 2020. The regulation applies to entry from all third countries and

     -     As of March 23/2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and
           household members) are banned in all states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with body
           care were closed. In public spaces , all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to other
           indivduals https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/besprechung-der-
