        Summary (as of 07/07/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 2.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
              total of 112 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 196,944 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,024 deaths due to COVID-19 have
              been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •     COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reportedsporadically in nursing homes and hospitals as well as
              refugee facilities.
        •     Outbreaks of COVID-19 in meat processing plants have been reported in several federal states. In
              the district of Guetersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, such an outbreak led to a high 7-day

    Table 2 shows the mean age, gender distribution, percentage of hospitalized cases and deaths among
    cases reported in calendar weeks 10 to 27. The percentage of deaths in weeks 26 and 27 are not yet
    meaningful, as the outcome is not yet known for all cases.
    The depiction of notified COVID-19 cases in Germany according to age groups and reporting week,
    shows a continuous and distinct relative decrease among the over 80 year olds from reporting week 17
    to reporting week 24, accompanied by a decrease in absolute case numbers that persited in the ensuing
    weeks. The proportion of cases in the younger age groups up to 29 years of age increased from week 17
    to week 24 (Figure 4), with only small fluctuations since then. Absolute case numbers in children and
    adolescents under 20 years of age increased up to week 15, after which the continuously decreased
    until week 21. After plateauing until week 24, they increased markedly in this age group in week 25, only
    to decrease again in the two following weeks (see Table in Figure 4).

    weeks 10 to 26 (07/07/2020 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cses is depicted by the red line.
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 168,219 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,087 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,673 of 24,851 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,507 (17%) of 171,650 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 182,700 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,024 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,992 (55%) are men and 4,027 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,728 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
    among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
    reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Countries of Exposure
    Borders have begun to open since reporting week 25, initially in Europe. Since then, among the
    countries reported as the probable place of exposure, the proportion of countries other than Germany
    has increased. This proportion peaked at 58% in reporting week 11, after which it rapidly decreased in
    association with the implemented travel restrictions, remaining beween 0.6 and 2.6% in weeks 15 to 25.
    In reporting weeks 26 and 27, this proportion increased to 3.5% and 8.9%, respectively. Table 6 lists the
    countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks 25 to 27 (countries
    mentioned in at least 5 cases).

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in one district,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia.
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in two districts,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia) and the district of Dingolfing-Landau (Bavaria).
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
    processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
    for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant remains temporarily closed and all employees are in quarantine
    together with their household members. The first employees were discharged from quarantine 14 days
    after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 hours after resolution of symptoms.
    In the district of Dingolfing-Landau, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among residents and staff in a shared
    accommodation for asylum seekers.
    In the district of Germersheim, an increase in COVID-19 cases was observed in connection with a
    religious community.

    A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
    well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.
    Figure 5: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 07/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 03/07/2020).
    A sensitive R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    possibly exposed persons, leading to therapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases.
    This can lead to relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the
    case in Germany - the total number of new cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is
    0.81 (95%-prediction interval: 0.68 – 0.96) and is based on electronically notified cases as of
    07/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.84 (95% prediction
    interval: 0.76 – 0.92) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 07/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day

   DIVI intensive care register
        A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
        RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
        well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
        (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
        number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
        hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
        As of 07/07/2020, a total of 1,273 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,572
        intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,967 (64%) are occupied, and 11,605 beds (36%) are
        currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.

        *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
        differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
        discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
        of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
        at short notice based on new insights.
        Infection risk
        The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
        behaviour.
        Disease severity
        In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
        increasing age and underlying illnesses.

      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
      capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
      burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
