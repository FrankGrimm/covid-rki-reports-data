COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 04/08/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    In the past few weeks, the number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
          has decreased markedly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal states. This
          trend is concerning.
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 5.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 70 districts transmitted zero
          cases over the past 7 days. In a further 218 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000
          inhabitants.
     •    In total, 211,281 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,156 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >270
          cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company and among employees of a canning
          company.
     •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
          nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, as well as in the context of
          religious or family events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 04/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      An increase in the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases occurred over the past 2 weeks in many of
      the federal states. Case numbers have increased considerably again today following somewhat lower
      case numbers due to testing and reporting delays on the two week-end days.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case outbreaks in different administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and
      health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning
      from travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing over the past two weeks. This
      development is very concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further
      worsening of the situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to
      be committed to decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and
      hygiene - also in outdoor settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community
      or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 211,281
      (+879) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 70 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days decreased
      continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  As part of quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices, corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports) can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 65,998 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (04/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 6,259 were children under 10 years of age (3.0%), 11,278 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.3%), 94,435 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 62,264 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (30%), 31,111 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,472 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.6%). The age and/or gender was unknown in 469 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of
  48 years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (04/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  Figure 4 depicts notified COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age group
  and reporting week. It shows a continuous decrease in the relative proportion of people over 80 years of
  age from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a marked decrease in the number of
  cases, which also continued in the following weeks. In contrast, the proportion of cases in the younger
  age groups from 0 to 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a decrease in the number of
  cases. After reporting week 24, the proportion across all age groups entered a plateau phase with only
  slight fluctuations. The absolute number of cases increased in all age groups in the last three weeks.

  weeks 10 to 31 (21/07/2020, 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cases is depicted by the red line.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 179.284 (85%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (47%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,277
  cases (3.0%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance
  category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two
  symptoms was reported in 5,266 of 35,205 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,813 (17%) of 183,844 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 194,000 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,156 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.3% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,065 (55%) are men and 4,086 (45%) are women (see Table ), the gender was unknown in five
  cases. Table 2 depicts the proportion of hospitalization and deaths according to notification week.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Countries of Exposure
  Of the 211,281 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
  69,834 (33%).
  Borders have been opening since reporting week 25, initially within Europe. Since then, the eproportion
  of COVID-19 cases for whom countries other than Germany were reported as the country of exposure
  has increased. This proportion peaked at 46% (2,975 cases) in reporting week 11, after which it rapidly

  Despite the increase in the number of cases reported having a place of exposure abroad, the majority of
  recent cases acquired their infection in Germany. Through consistent prevention and early
  identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be prevented. To this end, testing for travellers
  returning from abroad is being offered free-of-charge, with mandatory testing for travellers from high
  risk countries to be implemented later this week (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/faq-tests-einreisende.html
  (in German)). In addition, it remains essential that people follow hygiene and distancing
  recommendations, avoid crowds and that all persons who develop COVID-19 compatible symptoms
  obtain testing immediately.
  Outbreaks
  Four districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts of
  Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, district Offenbach in Hesse, and the districts Herne and Kleve in North
  Rhine-Westphalia.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to two outbreaks with >390 COVID-19-cases, one among harvest
  workers of an agricultural company and the other among employees of a canning company. Quarantine
  was ordered for all employees of both companies. The local population (3,300 inhabitants) has been
  offered voluntary testing. In the district of Offenburg the increase in case numbers is predominantly due
  to cases among returning travelers; this is also explains a number of cases in Herne. In Kleve >60 cases
  were identified in conjunction with a large wedding celebration.

   Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
   family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
   Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
   The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
   since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
   transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
   temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
   analysis.
   The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
   R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
   the notification system.
   Figure 5: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
   cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
   electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 04/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 31/07/2020).
   A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
   estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
   This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
   outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
   affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
   relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
   The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.02 (95%-prediction interval: 0.81 – 1.21) and is based on
   electronically notified cases as of 04/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
   Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
   compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
   of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.99 (95% prediction
   interval: 0.89 – 1.09) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 04/08/2020, 12:00 AM.

      The reported 7-day R value has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a
      larger number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
      steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

   DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 04/08/2020, a total of 1,170 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,089 intensive
      care beds were registered, of which 19,547 (70%) are occupied, and 8,542 (30%) are currently available. The
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks).
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
       care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
       large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
       system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
