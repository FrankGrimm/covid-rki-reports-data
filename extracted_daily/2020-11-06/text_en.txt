 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 06/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
     strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 128.7 cases per 100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
     incidence of people ≥ 60 years has further increased to currently 86.2 cases/100.000 population.
 • The 7-day incidence in Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin, Hesse, Saarland and Bavaria is higher than the national
     total 7-day incidence.
 • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 7 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
     today, 119 districts have an incidence of >50-100 cases/100,000 population, 240 districts have an incidence of >100
     cases/100,000 population and of these, 9 districts have an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
 • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
     gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as
     in occupational settings or related to religious events.
 • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has almost tripled in the past 2 weeks from 1,121 patients on
     23/10/2020 to 2,753 patients on 06/11/2020.
 • In total, 619,089 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11,096 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
     to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 06/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has decreased and today is
      approximately 1. This means that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will infect on average one other
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently high in Germany, this means that the daily
      number of newly infected persons will remain high.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 308.852 cases (50%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (06/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases.
   Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 51% of cases, the
   numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
   considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
   the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
   persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
   particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 74% were female and 26% male.
   Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (405 of 412). By now, 240 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 9 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  119 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse most of the times, with several cases clustering in the context
  of celebrations with family and friends, but increasingly as well in community facilities and retirement
  and nursing homes. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the affected districts. At the same time, many small outbreaks in hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers
  and refugees, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to
  contribute to the increase of incidence.

       Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
       The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
       R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
       extracted from the notification system.
                                       4-day R-value                                                                 7-day R-value
                                            0.90                                                                          0.99

       Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
       less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

       The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past days the R-value has
       decreased slightly and is now approximately 1 today.

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
       As of 06/11/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,565
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,541 (75%) are occupied, and 7,024 (25%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

   *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
   reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
   in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Mortality Monitoring
   A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
   excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
   the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
   (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data
   have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
   monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
   An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
   April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also among
   those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
   Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. A fter a return to expected levels for most countries in May (with
   the exception of a heat-related peak in August), total all-cause mortality in the reporting countries has
   again increased above expected levels since calendar week 38. This is primarily due to increased
   mortality in Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal Spain and Switzerland. In week
   44, excess mortality was recorded, especially in the age group over 45 years of age.
   Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with a
   certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
   https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
   Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
   Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
   of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
   significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
   of May, with the exception of a heat-related increase in August. In September, however, deaths again
   increased to 5% above the expected number based on the mean number of deaths observed from 2016
   to 2019. In calendar week 41, 2020 (05/10 – 11/10/2020), 16.925 persons died (-316 compared to week
   40).
