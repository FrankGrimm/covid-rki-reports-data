Summary (as of 07/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    In total, 99,225 COVID-19 cases and 1,607 deaths due to COVID-19 have been electronically
     reported to the Robert Koch Institute in Germany.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 99,225 (+3,834) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 1,607 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and

    Figure 1: Number and cumulative incidence (per 100,000 population) of the 99,225 electronically reported COVID-19 cases in
    Germany by county and federal state (07/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health
    authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 39,086 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 50% are respectively male or female. Among notified cases, there are 768 children
    under 5 years of age, 1,948 children aged 5 to 14 years, 69,286 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 19,115 aged
    60 to 79 years and 7,899 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 209 notified cases is
    unknown. The median age of cases is 49 years.

    information available (07/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 73,780 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are
    cough (52%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 1,673 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 10,726 (14%) of 74,018 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 33,300 persons are estimated to have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases
    were considered to have recovered if they had a known symptom onset before 24/03/2020, were not
    reported to have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged
    and did not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of symptom onset,
    symptoms, hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
    The 1,607 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 1,012 (63%) men and 592 (37%)
    women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 105 years. Of all deaths, 1,395 (87%) were in
    persons 70 years or older, but only 15% of all cases were in this age group. Reports on COVID-19 related
    outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively
    high.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The reproduction number is the number of persons in average infected by a case. This number can only be
      estimated and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimation is R = 1.3 (1.0-
      1.6). This is based on the number of cases with disease onset between 31/03/2020-03/04/2020 and
      27/03/2020-30/03/2020 and an average generation time of 4 days. Cases with more recent disease onset
      are not included because their low number would lead to an unstable estimation.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
