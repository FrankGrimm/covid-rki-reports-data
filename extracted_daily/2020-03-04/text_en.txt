    parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and other federal states have become infected with SARS-CoV-2. More than 110
    cases have been attributed to this outbreak so far. The efforts of the crisis team in the district are concentrated
    on ensuring acute medical care.
    In addition, exclusion diagnoses are carried out in several federal states. Current figures to confirm cases are
    available on the RKI website at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html
    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 262 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 148 cases from 12 states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 148 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (04/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 90 are male (60%) and 59 female (40%). The age range is from 2 to 69 years, including 6
    children under the age of 5, 3 children aged 5-14 and 138 persons (93%) in the age groups 15 to 79 years (see
    Figure 2). For one person, the date is unknown. The median age is 37 years.

      Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 02/03/2020. In 53 cases, onset of symptoms is
      unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3). The first COVID-19-case in Germany was lab-
      confirmed on 27/01/2020.

      alternatively by date of reporting (04/03/2020)
      Clinical information is available for 108 cases submitted, of which 7 cases were reported as not showing
      symptoms significant for COVID-19. The most common symptoms mentioned were cough (64 von 108, 59%),
      fever (45 von 108, 42%), and rhinitis (36 von 108, 33%). Pneumonia was reported in 3 cases (3%). Additionally,
      general symptoms such as headache, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, myalgia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
      lymphadenopathy and apathy were reported.
      Further information
      In a hotel on Tenerife there were 6 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-cases. Among the more than 800 hotel
      guests were 171 German citizens, of whom no confirmed case is known to date. On 28/02/2020, 130 people who
      had only checked in after the index case had been checked out left the hotel. The competent health authorities
      of the home towns were informed of the entry of Category 2 contact persons.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Currently, there are insufficient
      data available to finally assess severity of COVID-19. Severe and fatal courses occur in some cases. The import of
      additional individual cases in Germany can be expected. Further single individual transmission events and chains
      of infection within Germany as well as local infection occurrences are possible. Therefore the risk to the German
      general population due to COVID-19 from China is currently considered to be moderate. However, a global
