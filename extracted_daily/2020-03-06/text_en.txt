    Almost all cases in North Rhine-Westphalia are linked to a large outbreak in the Heinsberg district. In the context
    of large carnival events, numerous people from the district of Heinsberg, but also people from other parts of
    North Rhine-Westphalia and other federal states contracted infection with SARS-CoV-2. Among cases with a
    history of travel to Italy, an increasing number reported South Tyrol as the probable place of exposure.
    In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states. Current figures on confirmed cases
    are available on the RKI website at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html
    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 639 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 298 cases from 14 states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 298 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (06/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 171 are male (57%) and 127 female (37%). The age range is from 2 to 77 years, including 6
    children under the age of 5, 5 children aged 5-14 and 284 persons (96%) in the age groups 15 to 79 years (see
    Figure 2). The median age is 40 years.

      Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 05/03/2020. In 126 cases, onset of symptoms
      is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Currently, there are insufficient
      data available to finally assess severity of COVID-19. Severe and fatal courses occur in some cases. The import of
      additional individual cases in Germany can be expected. Further single individual transmission events and chains
      of infection within Germany as well as local infection occurrences are possible. Therefore the risk to the German
      general population due to COVID-19 from China is currently considered to be moderate. However, a global
      spread of the pathogen seems increasingly likely. This assessment may change in the short term as a result of
      new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas
      -     As of 05/03/2020, the following regions are classified as risk areas (www.rki.de/covid-19-risikogebiete):

                 o In Italy: The region of Lombardy, the region of Emilia-Romagna and the city of Vo in the province of

                       Trentino-South Tyrol
