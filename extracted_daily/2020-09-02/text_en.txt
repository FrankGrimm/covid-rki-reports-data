COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 02/09/2020 12:00 AM)
            Since calendar week 35 the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has slightly decreased after a rise between
             calendar week 29 and 34. Although the number of new cases has started to decrease, the situation
             must still be carefully monitored.
            The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
             total of 20 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 154 districts the 7-day-
             incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
            In Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen and Hesse, the 7-day incidence is considerably
             higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
            In total, 244,855 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,313 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
            Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, educational settings,
             various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among
             travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 02/09/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July has stabilized in the last week and the 7-day
    incidence has fallen again nationwide. The R-value is currently below 1. It is noticeable that in the last few
    weeks more young people have become infected, thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger
    age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
    situations, e.g. larger celebrations in the family and among friends. In addition, COVID-19 cases are
    identified to a large extent among travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups.
    The current development is positive, but must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the
    proportion of deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of
    younger people among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A
    renewed increase in new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a
    renewed increase among the elderly and particularly among vulnerable groups of the population, as was
    the case at the beginning of the pandemic. If more elderly people become infected again, a renewed
    increase in hospitalizations and deaths must be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
    and, where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially
    indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of
    family and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 244,855
    (+1,256) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 20 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on
    16/06/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.
        Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 85,294 cases (35%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (02/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 8,685 were children under 10 years of age (3.5%), 16,352 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.7%), 114,194 persons aged 20 to 49 years (47%), 67,116 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (28%), 32,182 persons aged 70 to 89 years (13%) and 5,574 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.3%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 752 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 46 years
  (median age 45 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 203,255 (83%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (45%), fever (38%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,483 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 9,109 of 58,784 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 32,493 (15%) of 211,454 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 219,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,313 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.8% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,164 (55%) are men and 4,145 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,953 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 15% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  *for care according to § 33 IfSG only cases under 18 years of age are taken into account, as other information may be assumed to be incorrect.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 3).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  In 12 districts an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants was reported. Affected
  are mainly districts in the federal state of Bavaria. The increased incidence in the affected districts is
  mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but also to transmission in family and
  other private events.
  In the district Trier-Saarburg, an outbreak occurred in a facility for asylum seekers. All residents of the
  facility are under quarantine.
  In the district Dachau, several residents and employees of a senior citizens' facility are infected with
  SARS-CoV-2.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.

  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.
  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 02/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 29/08/2020).
  A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
  estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
  This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
  outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
  affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
  relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
  The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.80 (95%-prediction interval: 0.66 - 0.97) and is based on
  electronically notified cases as of 02/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
  Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
  compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
  of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.91 (95% prediction
  interval: 0.83 – 1.01) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 02/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
  The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020 . Since the beginning of the past week
  they are around 1 or slightly below 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to
  increasing cases among travellers, particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but
  also to a still existing larger number of smaller outbreaks and thereby, the country wide case numbers
  altogether, which had risen in the last weeks.

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 02/09/2020, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
     30,779 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,833 (71%) are occupied, and 8,946 (28%) are
     currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
     well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
     data are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test
     laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based
     SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
     (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 35/2020, 12,383,035 laboratory
     tests have been recorded to date, 282,600 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
     Up to and including week 35, 252 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
     one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis.
     Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
     the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
     the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
     (see Table 5).

      Testing of travellers at German points of entry
      At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres
      have been established. Some of the laboratories attached to those test centres have voluntarily
      provided aggregated statistics on the number of tests. For week 35/2020, 161,105 tests were reported
      from these entry points, of which 1,573 were positive (0.98%). It is not possible to say to which extent
      these 161,105 tests are included in those reported in Table 5.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
      dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
      worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
      beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week.
      Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with
      celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age
      groups, have also contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no
      approved vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 02/09/2020

     The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
     very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
     the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
     measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
     play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
     indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
     is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
     maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
     risk of transmission outdoors.
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
     individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
     previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
     Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
     main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
