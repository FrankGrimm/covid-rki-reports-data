      The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.
    2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3
      The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
      data were not recorded regularly.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
      – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
      Summary (as of 05/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general
           population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 11,897 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 944 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI
           in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 135 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national
           incidence.
      • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 289 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 42
           districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 111 and of people ≥80 years 275 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and
           nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 05/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 5,678 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 868 existing patients were discharged
           (37% of whom had died) and 802 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 66 less than the prior
           day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 316,962 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
      • Testing and notification activities may have been lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete picture of the
           epidemiological situation in Germany of the previous two weeks.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 05/01/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
      detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
      following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
      19 disease.
      General current assessment
      Since the beginning of December, there has been a renewed sharp rise in the number of cases. During the
      holidays, the number of cases decreased. Whether the number of infections is actually declining will only
      become clear in the course of the next few days.
      The R-value is currently below 1. Nevertheless, the daily number of new cases remains high due to the large
      number of current cases. Furthermore, during the festive season the detection, notification and
      transmission of COVID-19-cases is delayed, thus the R-value may be underestimated.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
      and long-term care homes and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
      Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
      serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.
      On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Risk
      Assessment on 29/12/2020. To date, it is unknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19
      pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been detected in numerous countries around the world.
      It is expected that infections with the new variant will be detected in further countries. So far, a few cases
      of this new variant have been transmitted to the RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also
      reported another new virus variant detected in South Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility
      and more severe disease.
      Due to the holidays, it should be noted when interpreting the case numbers that, on the one hand, fewer
      people usually visited a doctor, as a result of which fewer samples were taken and fewer laboratory tests
      were performed. This may lead to fewer notified cases at the local level and hence to fewer transmitted
      COVID-19 cases to the RKI. Furthermore, not all local and state health authorities transmit data to the RKI
      on all days.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,787,410
  (+11,897) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 995,739 cases (56%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

  the weeks 10 to 53 (05/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  The first wave of the pandemic in Germany started in week 11 with a high 7-day incidence in 20-59-year-
  olds followed by a rising incidence in the over-80 years old until week 15, which fell again until week 24,
  Since reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence has increased steadily starting in younger age-
  groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups. Until week 51 an increase of the 7-day
  incidence could be seen in all age groups, especially in the age groups 80 years and older. Wether the
  decrease in the 7-day incidence since week 52 across all age groups is actually a trend or is caused solely by
  the limited detection, notification and transmission of COVID-19 cases during the holidays season will
  become clearer in the coming few weeks.

  Figure 3 displays the percentages of deceased, hospitalized and cases with COVID-19 relevant symptoms.
  The percentage of deaths among cases was less than 1% between week 30 and 41. An increasing trend is
  visible from week 36 onwards. In the weeks 47 to 49 it is between 2.1 and 2.5%. As deaths occur on average
  only 2-3 weeks after infection, further reports of deaths among currently reported cases are expected for
  weeks 50-53. The proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 cases increased from 5% in week 35 to 10% in week
  52. The percentage of cases with COVID-19 relevant symptoms is since week 38 over 80%. These
  percentages may equally change due to delayed reporting and data corrections. During the summer (weeks
  26-36) these proportions were lower at 65% and 77%. During that time period returning travelers were
  increasingly tested, among whom asymptomatic infections were detected more frequently. The data on
  which the figure is based and that were published here on previous Tuesdays can be found at:

  *During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
  The figures on the first page show the number of deaths reported daily according to date of entry at RKI. This
  may also include cases with a date of death several days in the past. Figure 4 shows the reported COVID-19
  deaths by calendar week according to the date of death. For recent weeks, further reports of deaths among
  reported cases can be expected.
  A significant increase in the number of deaths was observed since week 37. Of all deaths, 31,402 (88%) were
  among people aged 70 years or older, with a median age of 84 years (Table 3), while this age group accounts
  for only 15% of all cases. Thus far, 17 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported
  to the RKI. Child deaths are still being validated.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
  proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  Table 4: Notified COVID-19-cases according to possible occupation, accommodation or care in facilities relevant for transmission of
  infectious diseases according to the Protection Against Infection Act (IfSG), reported to RKI (n=232,984 cases; 05/01/2021, 12:00

  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
  among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Possible countries of exposure
  In weeks 50 to 53, of the 588,899 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure
  was missing in 310,328 (53%) cases. In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that
  had a possible foreign country as place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0,4% in reporting week 19 as a
  result of travel restrictions.
  As of reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting
  a probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined again
  since then. The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the summer
  vacation period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week. Since then, it has decreased
  to currently 284 cases in week 53. In weeks 50-53, a total of 1,324 persons (less than 0.3% of all cases)
  reported a possible site of infection abroad.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 05/01/2021

  Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
  quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (for further details
  see https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for every district (412/412).
  There are 42 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is known to be the cause of the
  high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated incidence, for example
  outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                         7-day R-value
                                0.66                                                                0.81
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.56 – 0.78)                                    (95%-prediction interval: 0.75 – 0.87)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value. During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and
  transmitted with delays, thus the R-value may be under-estimated.

    *During the festive season COVID-19 cases are detected, notified and transmitted with delays.
    The R-value is currently below 1. Nevertheless, the daily number of new cases remains high due to the large
    number of current cases. Furthermore, during the festive season the detection, notification and
    transmission of COVID-19-cases is delayed, thus the R-value may be underestimated.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
    with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
    number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
    with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
    As of 04/01/2021, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,875
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,369 (83%) are occupied, and 4,506 (18%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
       patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
       cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
       population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
       as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households. occupational settings and nursing and
       senior care homes.
       Therefore. more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
       is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
       substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
