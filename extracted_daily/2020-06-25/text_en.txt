    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 4,983 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,108 of 21,281 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,008 (17%) of 166,875 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 176,800 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,735 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in four districts,
    primarily due to localised outbreaks: The districts of Guetersloh and the neighbouring districts of
    Warendorf and Hamm (all North Rhine-Westphalia) and the district of Goettingen (Lower Saxony).

    The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
    plant. The 7-day high incidence in Warendorf and Hamm is linked to the outbreak in Guetersloh.
    Employees of the meat processing company are residents of neighbouring districts. More than 1,500
    employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and
    all employees are being quarantined as well as their household members. In addition, all schools and
    day-care centres in the district have been closed since 18th of June until the end of the summer holidays
    (11th of August 2020s). On June 23, 2020, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia officially activated the
    second stage of a lockdown for the districts of Guetersloh and Warendorf until June 30, 2020. In the
    affected region, testing for SARS-CoV-2 is being significantly expanded. Nursing facilities, hospitals,
    employees in the food retail sector, kiosk staff and residents of central shared accommodation will be
    tested in Gütersloh and Warendorf. The population can have a test performed free of charge. There
    have also been and still are outbreaks in meat processing plants in other federal states, some of which
    have led to production closures.
    A large COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the district of Goettingen, in the context of highly crowded
    housing conditions. All inhabitants of one large apartment complex have been quarantined, control- and
    support measures are being carried out along with extensive testing. Additionally, an outbreak in a
    refugee facility is reported, affecting more than 20 people.
    Decreasing 7-day incidence is reported from the city of Magdeburg, Saxony (an outbreak that led to
    closing of several schools), in Neukoelln, a district of Berlin, (an outbreak is linked to members of a
    religious community with more than one hundred cases;an entire block of flats has been quarantined)
    and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, another district of Berlin (47 cases in a block of flats so far).
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

7                                                                                                                     7
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0,59 (95%-prediction interval: 0,48 – 0,73)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 24/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.11 (95% predictation
      interval: 1.03 – 1.19) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 24/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      The estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) have decreased to a value of 1 or
      below. The strongly increased values in the past few days are related to local accumulations, which are
      described in the section "Outbreaks", with the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly
      important role. The dynamics of the various outbreak events are also influenced in part by serial tests
      carried out in the scope of the detected outbreaks, which can promptly lead to the detection of further
      infected persons. For this reason, the reproduction figures may continue to fluctuate strongly. Since the
      case numbers in Germany are at a low level overall, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong
      influence on the value of the reproduction number.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 25/06/2020, a total of 1,276 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,507
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,073 (65%) are occupied, and 11,434 beds (35%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

      Information from additional RKI-based surveillance
systems for acute respiratory illnesses
           GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
           (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 25, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
           stable. Since the end of the influenza epidemic in week 12, 2020, the ARI rate has been markedly lower
           than in previous seasons at this time of the year. Further information can be found under
           https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
           The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
           practices. In week 25, 2020, the number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections increased,
           but remained at a very low level. The increase in patient visits is mainly due to a rise in a rise in visits of
           patients from the age group 0 to 4 years. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses
           were detected in 13 of 40 samples (33%) in week 25, 2020. Rhinovirus was found in 12 samples,
           parainfluenzavirus was detected in one sample. Since week 15, 2020, no influenza activity has been
           observed within the viral surveillance of the AGI. No SARS-COV-2 has been detected since week 16,
           2020. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
           A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
           patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
           the lower respiratory tract). In week 24, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased markedly, but
           remainsat a very low level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 24, 2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-
           19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 5). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10
           Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this
           analysis.

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
        of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
        at short notice based on new insights.
        Infection risk
        The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
        behaviour.
        Disease severity
        In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
        increasing age and underlying illnesses.
        Burden on health system
        The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
        capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
        burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
