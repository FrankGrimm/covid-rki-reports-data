 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 Further data is available in the COVID 19 dashboard: https://corona.rki.de

  Summary (as of 26/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
      COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must still
      be carefully monitored.
  • The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 13.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
      The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 4 districts: the cities of Hamm and
      Remscheid and the district of Dingolfing-Landau and Rhön-Grabfeld. A total of 11 districts
      transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
  • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg is considerably higher, in North Rhine-
      Westphalia noticeably higher, and in Hesse slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • In total, 282,730 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,452 deaths associated with COVID-19
      have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
      clusters occur particularly in nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees,
      community facilities, various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and
      among travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 26/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, further increase is currently observed
      in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is
      currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among travel returnees is decreasing since
      calendar week 34. The R-value is currently above 1.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends or, especially in cases among
      younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees.
      The current development must be further carefully monitored.
      The proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases reported since calendar week no. 30 lies below 1%. The
      proportion has decreased in comparison to the situation in spring. It is unlikely that the virus has
      changed and is now less pathogenic. There may be different reasons for the low proportion of deaths.
      On the one hand infections occur mainly among young people, who rarely experience a severe course of
      disease and die. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means more mild cases are
      identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the proportion of severe courses of disease
      and deaths only becomes apparent some time after diagnosis. If the trend continues and more elderly
      and vulnerable people get infected, an increase in hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
      where necessary, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
      be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 282,730
  (+2,507) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1). A total of 11 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a
  total of 139 districts reported zero cases.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 104,535 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (26/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Tabelle 2).
   The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  In 24 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
  the cities of Hamm and Remscheid and the district of Dingolfing-Landau and Rhön-Grabfeld, with 7-day
  incidences of > 50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to 150 cases in connection with a wedding.
  More than 300 identified guests are quarantined and required to be tested. Stricter distancing measures
  have been implemented in Hamm (https://www.hamm.de/aktuelles/weitere-corona-massnahmen-
  beschlossen).
  The increased incidence in Dingolfing-Landau is mainly explained by a COVID-19 outbreak at an industrial
  concern and associated logistic partners. Mass testing was implemented; >30 cases have been diagnosed
  thus far.
  The 7-day incidence in the city of Remscheid strongly increased again to over 50 cases/100,000
  inhabitants on 25/09/2020. Here, cases were mainly found among contact persons of confirmed cases
  and can be attributed mostly to families that have returned from holidays: Several schools and nurseries
  are affected. Increased measures (e. g. broad quarantine) have been implemented
  (https://remscheid.de/corona#chapter146380100000143530-1015_sp_main_iterate_1_0).
  The 7-day incidence in the district of Rhön-Grabfeld increased over 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants. Most
  of the cases can be traced back to a wedding ceremony.
  The increased incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to transmission during family and other
  private events. The proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-
  19-related outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.

       Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
       The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
       R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
       extracted from the notification system.

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
       As of 26/09/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,497
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,760 (71%) are occupied, and 8,737 (29%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     General assessment
     At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
     dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
     worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
     beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased markedly. Many of these cases were
     associated with travellers. Since calendar week 35 transmissions within Germany can be observed to a
     larger extent. Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in
     connection with celebrations with family and friends and at group events. There are still no approved
     vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
     The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
     very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
     the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
     measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
     play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
     indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m is
     maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained,
     e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of
     transmission outdoors.
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
     individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
     previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
     Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
     main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
     (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
     rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
