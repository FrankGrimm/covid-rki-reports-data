COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Law (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recored nationwide data
on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

        Summary (as of 21/06/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The number of newly transmitted COVID-19 cases to RKI continues to decrease in comparison to
              previous weeks. The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.9 cases per
              100,000 inhabitants. A total of 146 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 189,822 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,882 deaths due to COVID-19 have
              been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •     COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals.
        •     Outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported in several federal states (including in institutions for
              asylum seekers and refugees, in meat processing plants and logistics companies, among seasonal
              harvest workers and in connection with religious events and family gatherings).

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the

    Distribution of cases over time
    Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by date of symptom onset or alternatively by
    date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (21/06/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Approximately 174,900 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    In total, 8,882 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.7% of all confirmed cases).
    So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-
    existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 26% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence rate was observed in four districts, primarily due to localised outbreaks: The
    districts of Gütersloh and Warendorf (both North Rhine-Westphalia) and the cities of Magdeburg
    (Saxony Anhalt) and Neukölln (city district of Berlin).
    The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
    plant. More than one thousand employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was
    temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are being quarantined as well as their household
    members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the district have been closed since 18th of June
    until the end of the summer holidays (11th of August 2020s). The town of Verl, located in the affected
    district, has enforced a quarantine zone for those areas in which higher numbers of the processing
    plant’semployees are housed. The outbreak in Guetersloh is linked to an outbreak in Warendorf.
    Employees of the meat processing company are residents of neighbouring districts.
    In Magdeburg, an outbreak affecting several now closed schools has led to an increase in the 7-day
    incidence.
    In Neukölln, a district of Berlin, an outbreak is linked to members of a religious community. So far 85
    cases are linked to this outbreak.
    Once again there were major outbreaks in retirement- and nursing homes. In the district of Verden
    residents and nursing staff have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Further outbreaks were reported among members of religious communities, eg. from Berlin, Hesse and
    and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
      analysis.
                                                                               Cases:                     Symptom onset reported

      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 21/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 17/06/2020).
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 2.88 (95%-prediction interval: 2.16 – 3.73)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 21/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 2.03 (95% predictation
      interval: 1.60 – 2.49) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 21/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      Estimates of the reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) were between 2 and 3 during the
      last few days. This is mainly related to local outbreaks which are described above, the outbreak in North
      Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role in this context . Since case numbers in Germany
      are generally low, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the

       reproduction number. Further developments need to be monitored closely during the upcoming days,
       especially in regard to whether case numbers are increasing outside of outbreak contexts.
       Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
       R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
       also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
