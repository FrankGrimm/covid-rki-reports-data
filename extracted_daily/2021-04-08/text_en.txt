  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  Figure 1: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=2.796.222) cases with respective data in
  the weeks 15 to 53, 2020, and weeks 01-13, 2021 (as of 06/04/2021, 12:00 AM). Data from the mandatory surveillance system
  according to the German Data Protection Act.
  Figure 2 displays the total number of cases with or without COVID-19 relevant symptoms as well as
  proportion of hospitalized and deceased. As deaths occur on average 2-3 weeks after infection, further
  reports of deaths are expected for the most recent three weeks. The data on which the figure is based can
  be found at: www.rki.de/covid-19-tabelle-klinische-aspekte .

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
     clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
     ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey,
     via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance
     established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a
     professional association of laboratory medicine.
     The number of tests, the proportion of positive tests as well as the number of reporting laboratories since
     the beginning of testing in Germany are shown in table 2. Since laboratories can register and correct the
     tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can change
     retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of persons
     tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients (Table 2) with data for the last weeks –
     complete data since beginning of testing are available at (in German). The current testing criteria can be
     found under: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In week 13, 2021, the ARI rate decreased in total. The ARI rate
     decreased substantially in the age group 0 to 14 years, and remained stable in all other age groups. Since
     week 36, 2020, the total ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years. Further information can be
     found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network on primary care level. In week
     13, 2021, the overall number of patient visits (consultations) due to ARI (ARI consultation rate) decreased.
     The ARI consultation rate decreased or remained stable in all age groups. The ARI consultation rate
     remained on a substantially lower level compared to previous years. Within the virological surveillance of
     the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 74 of 123 sentinel samples (60%) in week 13, 2021. Among
     those, rhinovirus was identified in 46 (37%), human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) in 23 (19%), SARS-CoV-2 in
     seven (6%) and Parainfluenzavirus was found in three samples (2%). Further information - both on national
     and regional level - can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/ and under
     https://influenza.rki.de/Diagrams.aspx?agiRegion=0.
     A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
     (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
     respiratory tract). The number of SARI cases increased substantially in the age groups 35 to 59 and 60 to 79
     years in week 12, 2021. In all the other age groups the number of SARI cases remained stable or decreased
     slightly. The increase in the age group 80 years and above did not continue in week 12, 2021. The
     proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI has fluctuated around 50% in the last few weeks. In week
     12, 2021, 58% of the reported SARI cases per week were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!)
     (Figure 4). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main
     diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. It highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the
      occurrence of many outbreaks especially in households, day-care facilities for children and increasingly in
      schools as well as and occupational settings.
      Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
      rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
      outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
      vulnerable persons.
      On 31/03/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
      current version can be found here: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).
  Measures taken in Germany
      -    As of April 7th 2021, the recommendation for contact management in Germany did change. Further

  Annex
     1
       The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
       transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
     2
       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
       number of recovered cases.
     3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
       hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
