COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 25/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore,
    the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 74.9 cases per 100,000 population.
 • The 7-day incidence in Berlin, Bremen, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, and Saarland is higher than
    the national total 7-day incidence.
 • The number of districts with an increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants continues to rise,
    to 363 urban and rural districts. Of these, 71 districts have an incidence of > 100 cases/100,000 population and
    179 districts have an incidence of > 50-100 cases/100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again
    (see Daily Situation Report of 20.10.2020).
 • A number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are being
    reported particularly in the context of family events, and in nursing homes.
 • In total, 429,181 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,032 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
    transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 25/10/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in nearly all federal states. The
      proportion of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently increasing. Since the start of October,
      R-values have been clearly above 1.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Since end July, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below 1% and is
      thus markedly lower than in the spring, particularly in April (ref. Daily Situation Report of 20 Oct 2020).
      However, it is regarded as implausible that the virus has become less pathogenic. Rather, the low
      proportion of deaths can be explained as follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred
      mainly among young people, who most of the time experience a less severe course of disease. On the
      other hand there is also broader testing, which means more milder cases are identified.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 429,181
  (+11,176) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown for 188,947 cases (44%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

    unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (25/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
    information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
    reported COVID-19 cases.
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 38.5% of cases,
    the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
    according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
    The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
    Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
    Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
    care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
    The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
    outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Due to changes in data registration, not all data entries for cases ascertained in the most recent version of the surveillance software could be
  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 363 districts,
  including 71 urban and rural districts with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 179
  districts with a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with occasional clustering in the context of celebrations with
  family and friends. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the affected districts. However, many small outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals
  and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, and community facilities, kindergartens and schools,
  various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the
  increase of incidence.
  In the district of Erzgebirgskreis, COVID-19 cases have occurred in more than 11 inpatient care facilities.
  In the district of Rottal-Inn, the increased incidence is partly due to an outbreak among residents of a
  shared accommodation, as well as to cases of infected residents and employees in a nursing home.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
      extracted from the notification system.
                              4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                    1.45                                                             1.39
             (95%-prediction interval: (1.17 – 1.71)                             (95%-prediction interval: 1.22 – 1.52)
      Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
      less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 25/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 21/10/2020).
      Since the start of October the R-values have been clearly greater than 1.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
      As of 25/10/2020, a total of 1,284 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 29,294
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,908 (71%) are occupied, and 8,386 (29%) are currently
      available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
