2   COVID-19 Situation Report 17/03/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    Case numbers1
      With over 7,000 cases the number of COVID-19-cases can no longer be updated and validated manually.
      Therefore the reporting is changed. As of today (17/3/2020), epidemiological evaluations in the COVID-19
      situation report are based only on electronically transmitted data available to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at
      the time of the data closure (11 pm).
      A total of 7,156 (+1,723) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been detected
      in Germany since 27/01/2020, which were electronically reported to and validated at the RKI. So far, 12 deaths
      related to COVID-19 diseases were electroniclally reported.
      Information on laboratory-confirmed cases
      So far, 7,156 cases in 16 federal states have been laboratory-confirmed and electronically reported (see Table 1
      and Figure 1).

      of symptoms and alternatively by date of reporting (17/03/2020)
      Further information
      The 12 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 7 men and 5 women, from
      the 3 federal states Northrhine-Westfalia (6), Bavaria (4) and Baden-Wurttemberg (2). All deceased were older
      than 65 years of age; the mean age was 80 years and the medan age 82.5 years) In addition, 2 German tourists
      died of COVID-19 in Egypt on 08/03/20202 and 11/03/2020.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as high. However, this risk varies from region to region.
      The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The
      burden on the health care system depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and
      initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some
      regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     As of 12/03/2020, the following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:

            restaurants, bars and clubs, as well as school and daycare closures starting the week of 16/03/2020.
      -     As of 12/03/2020, the following regions are classified as risk areas (www.rki.de/covid-19-risikogebiete):
