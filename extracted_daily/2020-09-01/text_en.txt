COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

        Summary (as of 01/09/2020 12:00 AM)
            Since calendar week 35 the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has slightly decreased after a rise between
             calendar week 29 and 34. Although case numbers have started to decrease in some states, the
             development over the past weeks remains concerning.
            The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
             total of 20 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 142 districts the 7-day-
             incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
            In Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bremen, Berlin, and Hesse, the 7-day incidence is considerably
             higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
            In total, 243,599 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,302 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
            Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, educational settings,
             various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among
             travellers.

       COVID-19 Situation Report 01/09/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can still be observed in Baden-
    Wuerttemberg, Bavaria and Bremen, while the 7-day incidence has decreased in some federal states. It is
    noticeable that the average age of infection decreased over the past few weeks and that the 7-day
    incidence particularly in younger age groups has increased and is much higher than in older age groups.
    Nationwide, there are reports of many small outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various
    settings, such as larger events with family and friends. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases are
    being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups.
    A further increase of case numbers must be avoided. On the one hand, the increase in younger age groups
    needs to be curbed; on the other hand, transmission into older and vulnerable groups needs to be
    prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises among elderly people, hospitalisations and number of
    deaths will likely rise again. This can only be prevented if the entire population continues to be committed
    to decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also
    outdoors -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, by wearing a community or face mask correctly.
    Large gatherings, especially indoors, should be avoided, and events with family and friends should be
    limited to close family members and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 243,599
    (+1,218) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 20 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on
    16/06/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 84,802 cases (35%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (01/09/2020, 12:00 AM).

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 8,617 were children under 10 years of age (3.5%), 16,193 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.7%), 113,382 persons aged 20 to 49 years (47%), 66,954 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (28%), 32,142 persons aged 70 to 89 years (13%) and 5,572 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.3%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 739 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 46 years
  (median age 45 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (01/09/2020,12:00 AM).
  The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 4 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
  the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
  proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
  from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
  cases. This development continued in the following weeks. In comparison, the proportion of cases in the
  younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
  decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
  a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations, but as of week 32 the proportion of cases among 10 to 30
  year olds is increasing. The absolute number of cases has been increasing since week 29.

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 202,143 (83%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (45%), fever (38%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,476 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 8,878 of 57,687 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 32,438 (15%) of 210,291 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 217,600 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

  Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The highest mean age
  of COVID-19 cases as well as the highest proportions of hospitalized patients and deaths were reported
  in weeks 16/17 and have been decreasing since. From week 29 to 35, the weekly number of total cases
  has been increasing again.
  A total of 9,302 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.8% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,156 (55%) are men and 4,142 (45%) are women (see Table 3), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,945 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 4).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 01/09/2020

  Possible countries of exposure
  Of the 243,599 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
  80,047 (33%) cases.
  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% (2,977 cases) for cases that had a possible
  foreign country as place of exposure and thereby the highest so far. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in
  reporting week 19 (26 cases) as a result of travel restrictions. Since the 25th reporting week, borders
  have reopened, initially in Europe. Since then, the proportion of cases reporting a probable country of
  infection abroad has markedly increased. In week 35, the proportion was 37% (3,159 cases) (Figure 5). In
  weeks 32-35, 2020, 13,191 persons reported a possible site of infection abroad, naming a total of 13,191
  countries (more than one country specified in some cases).
  Figure 5: Presentation of the cases with probable place of infection abroad compared to all other cases (exposure in Germany
  and place of exposure unknown) and the proportion of cases with exposure abroad, in reporting week 10 to 35, 2020.
  Table 5 lists the top 15 countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks
  31 to 34. The Western Balkan countries, as well as Turkey, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania were most
  frequently reported as the country of exposure. In week 35 France was also frequently mentioned as the
  country of infection. When looking at the different age groups (not shown), it is noticeable that among
  the cases with reports of a place of infection in Kosovo and Turkey, Romania and Albania children and
  middle-aged persons are over-represented, indicating possible family related visits. On the other hand,
  in the cases with a probable place of infection in Spain, Croatia and Bulgaria, persons between 20-29
  years of age were over-represented, suggesting tourism for recreation and pleasure.
  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad has increased significantly in recent
  weeks. Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases
  can be greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and
  hygiene and avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be
  tested immediately. In addition, travellers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry
  must maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).

  Outbreaks
  In 13 districts an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants was reported. The
  federal states mainly affected are districts in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria. The increased incidence
  in the affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but also to
  transmission in family and other private events.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 6 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.

   Figure 6: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
   cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
   electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 01/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 28/08/2020).
   A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
   estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
   This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
   outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
   affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
   relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
   The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.84 (95%-prediction interval: 0.70 - 1.04) and is based on
   electronically notified cases as of 01/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
   Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
   compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
   of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.89 (95% prediction
   interval: 0.81 – 0.97) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 01/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
   The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020 and are around 1 since the beginning of
   the past week. This was probably associated with an increasing number of cases among travel
   returnees, especially during school holidays, as well as a larger number of smaller outbreaks and the
   overall increased case numbers in Germany over recent weeks.

   DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
       As of 01/09/2020, a total of 1,282 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
       30,725 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,673 (71%) are occupied, and 9,052 (29%) are
       currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
       reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
       in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with a clear
       acceleration in recent weeks; it seems to have stabilized in the last few days. There are larger and
       smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in connection with celebrations in the circle of family and
       friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups, also contribute to
       the increase in the number of cases. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not available. The
       RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and as very high
       for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
       play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
       indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
       is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
       maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
       risk of transmission outdoors.

     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
     individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
     previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
     Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
