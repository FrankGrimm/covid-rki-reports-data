COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

        Summary (as of 27/08/2020 12:00 AM)
            Since calendar week 29 the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly overall and in many
             federal states. The number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has
             decreased markedly. Although case numbers have started to decrease in some states, this
             development remains very concerning.
            The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
             total of 20 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 133 districts the 7-day-
             incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
            In Hesse, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, the 7-day incidence is considerably higher, in Berlin
             and North Rhine Westphalia slightly higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
            In total, 237,936 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,285 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
            Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, educational settings,
             various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among
             travellers.

       COVID-19 Situation Report 27/08/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can still be observed in some
    federal states. It is noticeable that the average age of infection decreased over the past few weeks and that
    the 7-day incidence particularly in younger age groups has increased and is much higher than in older age
    groups.
    Nationwide, there are reports of many small outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various
    settings, such as larger events with family and friends. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases are
    being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups.
    A further worsening of the situation must be avoided. On the one hand, the increase in younger age groups
    needs to be stopped, on the other hand, transmission into older and vulnerable groups needs to be
    prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises among elderly people, hospitalisations and number of
    deaths will likely rise as well. This can only be prevented if the entire population continues to be committed
    to decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also
    outdoors -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, by wearing a community or face mask correctly.
    Large gatherings, especially indoors, should be avoided, and events with family and friends should be
    limited to close family members and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 237,936
    (+1,507) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 20 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few
    weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days decreased
    overall; on 12/07/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 125 districts.

       Germany by county and federal state (27/08/2020, 00:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 81,580 cases (34%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (27/08/2020, 12:00 AM).

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 8,281 were children under 10 years of age (3.5%), 15,374 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.5%), 109,920 persons aged 20 to 49 years (46%), 66,131 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (28%), 31,994 persons aged 70 to 89 years (13%) and 5,554 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.3%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 682 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 45 years
  (median age 46 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (27/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 197,937 (83%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (45%), fever (38%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,444 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 8,189 of 53,558 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 32,185 (16%) of 205,694 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status. Approximately 211,900 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection.
  Since the exact date of recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this
  number.
  A total of 9,285 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.9% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,143 (55%) are men and 4,138 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,934 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 3).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Outbreaks
  In 17 districts an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants was reported, including
  the city of Rosenheim in Bavaria with an incidence of >50 cases/ 100.000 inhabitants in the past 7 days.
  The federal states mainly affected are Hesse, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. The increased
  incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but
  also to transmission in family and other private events.
  In the city of Wiesbaden in Hesse, a COVID-19 outbreak among wedding guests, resulting in transmission
  into the communities, including schools and work places.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.
  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 27/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 23/08/2020).
  A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
  estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
  This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
  outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
  affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
  relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.

     The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.83 (95%-prediction interval: 0.67 – 1.02) and is based on
     electronically notified cases as of 27/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.94 (95% prediction
     interval: 0.85 – 1.05) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 27/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020 and are slightly below 1 again since the
     beginning of this week. According to current observations, this seems to be associated to a great extent
     with an increasing number of cases among travel returnees, especially during the school holidays, as
     well as a larger number of smaller outbreaks and the overall case numbers in Germany, which have
     increased steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of disease control measures.

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 27/08/2020, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
     30,747 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,715 (71%) are occupied, and 9,032 (28%) are
     currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
       systems for acute respiratory illnesses
      GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
      (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 34, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased.
      Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
      The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
      practices. In week 34, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
      increased slightly. The ARI incidence increased in the age group 5 to 15 years. Overall, it remained at a
      low level, similar to the level of previous seasons at this time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of
      the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 21 of 36 sentinel samples (58%) in week 34, 2020. Since week 16,
      2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected within the viral sentinel surveillance of the AGI. Further
      information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
      A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
      patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
      the lower respiratory tract). In week 33, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased. Of all reported
      SARI cases in week 33, 2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (see Figure 5).
      Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main
      diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.
      Figure 5: Weekly number of SARI cases (ICD-10 codes J09-J22) and proportion of cases with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10
      code U07.1!) among SARI cases with duration of hospitalisation of up to one week and with date of admission in weeks 12 to
      33, 2020, from 70 sentinel hospitals

  Data on emergency department utilisation
      In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
      the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
      https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
      As of 23 August 2020, data from 9 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between
      1 November 2019 and 1 March 2020, an average of 6,356 emergency department admissions per week
      was recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions
      was observed, to 3,697 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable
      surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions,
      public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase
      in admissions has been observed. In week 34 2020, 6,041 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the
      number of admissions is currently 5% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see
      Figure 6).

      average of 9 emergency departments; relative deviation to the reference period 1 November 2019 – 1 March 2020 (as of 23
      March 2020)
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
      mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with a clear
      acceleration in recent weeks. At the same time, the number of districts that have not reported any cases
      in the last 7 days is decreasing. There are larger and smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in
      connection with celebrations in the circle of family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees,
      especially in the younger age groups, also contribute to the increase in the number of cases. Vaccines
      and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of
      the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
      short notice based on new insights.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
     the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
     measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
     play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
     indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
     is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
     maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
     risk of transmission outdoors.
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
     individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
     previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
     Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
