COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data
on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

        Summary (as of 27/06/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
              total of 143 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 193,243 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,954 deaths due to COVID-19 have

    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. With regard to all cases
    reported from 01.03.2020 onwards, the onset of symptoms is unknown in 57,361 cases (30%). When the
    the onset of symptoms is unknown, the date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
    Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by date of symptom onset or alternatively by
    date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (27/06/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Approximately 177,500 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 8,954 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-
    existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in one district,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia).
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to the outbreak in Guetersloh as employees
    of the meat processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees tested
    positive for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are
    being quarantined as well as their household members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in
    the district of Guetersloh have been closed since 18th of June until the end of the summer holidays (11th
    of August 2020), in the neighboring district of Warendorf since 25th of June. On June 23, 2020, the state
    of North Rhine-Westphalia officially activated the second stage of a lockdown for the districts of
    Guetersloh and Warendorf until June 30, 2020. In the affected region, testing for SARS-CoV-2 is being
    significantly expanded. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in the food retail sector, kiosk staff and
    residents of central shared accommodation will be tested in Gütersloh and Warendorf. The population
    can have a test performed free of charge.
    There have also been and still are outbreaks in meat processing plants in other federal states, like in the
    district of Wesel in Northrhine-Westphalia and the district of Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. Both plants
    have been temporarily closed.
    COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 27/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 23/06/2020).
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.62 (95%-prediction interval: 0.50 – 0.77)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 27/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.83 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.74 – 0.93) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 27/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      The estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) have decreased to a value of 1 or
      below. The strongly increased values in the past few days are related to local accumulations, which are
      described in the section "Outbreaks", with the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly
      important role. The dynamics of the various outbreak events are also influenced in part by serial tests
      carried out in the scope of the detected outbreaks, which can promptly lead to the detection of further
      infected persons. For this reason, the reproduction figures may continue to fluctuate strongly.
      Since the case numbers in Germany are at a low level overall, these local outbreaks have a relatively
      strong influence on the value of the reproduction number.

       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
       R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
       also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
