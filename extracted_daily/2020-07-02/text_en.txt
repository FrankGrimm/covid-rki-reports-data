        Summary (as of 02/07/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
              total of 134 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 195,228 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,994 deaths due to COVID-19 have
              been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •     COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported sporadically in nursing homes and hospitals refugee
              facilities and religious communities.
        •     Outbreaks of COVID-19 in meat processing plants have been reported in several federal states. In
              the district of Guetersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, such an outbreak has led to a high 7-day
              incidence of over 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 195,228
    (+503) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been electronically
    reported to and validated by the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 134 districts reported no cases in the past 7
    days. Information on laboratory-confirmed cases is also available on the RKI website at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and https://corona.rki.de.

    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown in 58,261 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

    cases with information available (02/07/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 166,858 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,056 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,456 of 23,565 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,332 (17%) of 170,000 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 180,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,882 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (Section 42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing
    plants.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in two districts,
    the district of Guetersloh and the city of Duisburg (both North Rhine-Westphalia) .
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
    processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
    for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are in
    quarantine together with their household members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the
    district of Guetersloh were closed on 18/06/2020 until the end of the summer holidays (11/08/2020), in
    the neighboring district of Warendorf since 25/06/2020. On 23/06/2020, the state of North Rhine-
    Westphalia officially implemented the second stage of a lockdown for the districts of Guetersloh and
    Warendorf until 30/06/2020. Widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented in the affected
    region. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in the food retail sector, kiosk staff and residents of
    central shared accommodations are being tested in Gütersloh and Warendorf. Any resident can have a
    test performed free of charge.
    Currently, two further outbreaks in other meat processing plants are ongoing in the district of Wesel in
    Nort Rhine-Westphalia and the district of Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. Both plants were temporarily
    closed.
    A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
    well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

      Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 02/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 28/06/2020).
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.83 (95%-prediction interval: 0.67 – 1.02)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 02/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.83 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.74 – 0.91) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 02/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      In Mid-June, the estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) temporarily increased,
      but have since again decreased to a value of 1 or below. The marked increase was related to increased
      case numbers mainly due to local, outbreak-related COVID-19 transmission with the outbreak in North
      Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role (see section “Outbreaks”, above). The outbreak
      dynamics are also influenced in part by serial tests performed among possibly exposed persons, which
      led to the rapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases in some of the outbreak
      settings. Since the case numbers in Germany are at a low level overall, local outbreaks have a relatively
      strong influence on the value of the reproduction number. For this reason, the reproduction numbers
      may continue to fluctuate markedly.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

     DIVI intensive care register
         A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
         RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
         well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
         (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
         number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
         hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
         As of 02/07/2020, a total of 1,276 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,643
         intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,530 (66%) are occupied, and 11,113 beds (34%) are
         currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

         *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
         differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
         discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
Data on emergency department utilisation
         In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
         the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
         https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html
         .
         As of 28-06-2020, data from 10 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between
         01/11/2019 and 01/03/2020, an average of 6,608 emergency department admissions per week was
         recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was
         observed, to 3,969 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable
         surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions,
         public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase
         in admissions has been observed. In week 26, 2020, 6,230 admissions were recorded. This means that
         the number of admissions is currently still 6% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020
         (see Figure 5).

  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for actue respiratory illnesses
       GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
       (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 26, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased,
       mainly in the age group 0 to 4 years. Since the end of the influenza epidemic in week 12, 2020, the
       overall ARI rate has been markedly lower than in previous seasons at this time of the year. Further
       information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
       The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
       practices. In week 26, 2020, the number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections increased
       for the age groups 0 to 4 years and 5 to 14 years, but remained at a very low level overall. Within the
       viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 11 of 34 samples (32%) in week 25, 2020. Since
       week 15, 2020, no influenza activity has been observed within the viral surveillance of the AGI and no
       SARS-COV-2 has been detected since week 16, 2020. Further information can be found under
       https://influenza.rki.de/.
       A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
       patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
       the lower respiratory tract). In week 25, 2020, the total number of SARI cases decreased and remains at
       a very low level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 25, 2020, 4% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10
       code U07.1!) (See Figure 6). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code
       for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this
       analysis.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
        transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
        German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
        short notice based on new insights.
        Infection risk
        The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
        behaviour.
        Disease severity
        In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
        increasing age and underlying illnesses.
        Burden on health system
        The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
        capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
        burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
