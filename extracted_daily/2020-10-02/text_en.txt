 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 02/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
      COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. It is therefore still necessary for
      the entire population to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 15.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The 7-day
      incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 4 districts: the city of Hamm, the districts of
      Berlin Mitte and Rhön-Grabfeld, and the city of Remscheid. In a further 43 districts, it exceeded 25
      cases/100,000 inhabitants.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in Hamburg and North Rhine-
      Westphalia moderately higher, and in Bavaria and Hesse slightly higher than the national mean 7-
      day incidence.
  • In total, 294,395 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,508 deaths associated with COVID-19
      have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
      clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
      and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
      settings, and among travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 02/10/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The R-value has been predominantly slightly
      greater than 1 since the beginning of September.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can only be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 294,395
  (+2,673) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1). A total of 5 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a
  total of 139 districts reported zero cases.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously

    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown for 110,305 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

    unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (02/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
    information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
    reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
    missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
    reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
    above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
    facilities is unknown.
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
    according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
    The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
    Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
    Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
    care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
    The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
    outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 47 districts,
  including the city of Hamm, the districts of Berlin Mitte and Rhön-Grabfeld, and the city of Remscheid
  with 7-day incidences of >50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to about 200 cases in connection with a
  wedding. More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine
  (https://www.hamm.de/corona). Stricter distancing measures have been implemented in Hamm
  (https://www.hamm.de/aktuelles/weitere-corona-massnahmen-beschlossen).
  The outbreak in Berlin Mitte is attributable to a number of causes, such as the spread among young and
  international travellers and party guests, who contract the infection during travel or at parties and
  subsequently infect household members and family.
  In the district Rhön-Grabfeld cases can be partially attributed to an outbreak in a nursing/retirement
  home. Quarantine and isolation measures have been implemented.
  In the city of Remscheid the high incidence is primarily due to smaller outbreaks in day care centres and
  schools with spread to outside contacts. Stricter control measures have been implemented
  (https://remscheid.de/corona#chapter146380100000143530-1015_sp_main_iterate_1_0).
  Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to transmission at family and other private events. The
  proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-19-related
  outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community
  facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.

   Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
   The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
   R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
   extracted from the notification system.
                          4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                0.97                                                             1.08
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.79 – 1.16)                               (95%-prediction interval: 0.97– 1.20)
   Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
   cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
   electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 02/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 28/09/2020).
   The reported R values have been predominantly greater than 1 since the second week in September.
   Although the 4-day R-value is below 1 today, this development must continue to be monitored closely.
   Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
   under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
   https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
   23/04/2020).

 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
    collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
    well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
    16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
    (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
    As of 02/10/2020, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,482
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,801 (72%) are occupied, and 8,681 (28%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
    Table 3: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (02/10/2020, 12:15 PM).

          - of these: deaths                                          4,201             24%                                     4
    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account that the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number
    of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or
    increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Mortality Monitoring
    A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
    excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
    the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
    (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data
    have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
    monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
    An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
    April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also among
    those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
    Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. All-cause mortality for the countries in the EuroMOMO network
    has now largely returned to expected levels even if in some countries there seems to be a small excess
    mortality.
    Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with a
    certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
    https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
    Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
    Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
    of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
    significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
    of May. In calendar week 36, 2020 (31/08 – 06/09/2020), 16,308 people deceased (-32 compared to
    week 35).
