 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 27/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
      COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must still
      be carefully monitored.
  • The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 13.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
      The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 4 districts: the cities of Hamm and
      Remscheid and the district of Dingolfing-Landau and the district of Berlin-Mitte. A total of 12 districts
      transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg is considerably higher, and in Bavaria, Hesse and
      North Rhine-Westphalia noticeably higher higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • In total, 284,140 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,457 deaths associated with COVID-19
      have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
      clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
      and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
      settings, and among travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 27/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The R-value is currently slightly above 1.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees.
      The current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April (see Situation Report
      from 22/09/2020). It is unlikely that the virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low
      proportion of deaths can be explained as follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred
      mainly among young people, who rarely experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there
      is also broader testing, which means more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of
      cases increases, the true proportion of severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent
      some time after diagnosis. If the trend continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly
      infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and
      deaths can only be prevented through decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
      where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
      be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 284,140
  (+1,411) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1). A total of 12 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a
  total of 139 districts reported zero cases.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
   of symptoms is unknown for 105,351 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
   Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
   unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (27/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
   In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
   information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
   reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
   missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
   reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
   above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
   facilities is unknown.
   The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
   according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Tabelle 2).
   The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 28 districts,
  including the cities of Hamm and Remscheid and the districts of Dingolfing-Landau and Berlin-Mitte with
  7-day incidences of > 50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to 150 cases in connection with a wedding
  (https://www.hamm.de/corona). More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine.
  Stricter distancing measures have been implemented in Hamm
  (https://www.hamm.de/aktuelles/weitere-corona-massnahmen-beschlossen).
  The increased incidence in Dingolfing-Landau is mainly explained by a COVID-19 outbreak at an industrial
  company and associated logistic partners. Mass testing was implemented; >30 cases have been
  diagnosed thus far. The district administration has decreed the implementation stricter control measures
  (https://www.landkreis-dingolfing-landau.de/media/3063/allgemeinverfuegung-ldl-20200925.pdf).
  The 7-day incidence in the city of Remscheid again increased to over 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants on
  25/09/2020, after a brief decrease on 24/09/2020. Here, cases were mainly found among contact
  persons of confirmed cases and can be attributed mostly to families upon return from holidays. Several
  schools and nurseries are affected. Stricter control measures have been implemented
  (https://remscheid.de/corona#chapter146380100000143530-1015_sp_main_iterate_1_0).
  The 7-day incidence in the district of Rhön-Grabfeld increased to over 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants
  yesterday; today the incidence has fallen below this threshold. A high proportion of the cases can be
  traced back to a wedding ceremony.
  In the district of Berlin-Mitte the increased incidence is due to more diffuse transmission. Young adults
  have been frequently affected following international travel or attendance of parties with subsequent
  transmission in their households and families. The situation is similar in several other Berlin districts,
  with a 7-day incidence >25 cases/100,000 inhabitants reported from 4 other districts as well.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

      Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to transmission at family and other private events. The
      proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-19-related
     outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community
     facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
      extracted from the notification system.
                             4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value

            (95%-prediction interval: 0.95 – 1.40)                               (95%-prediction interval: 0.91 – 1.13)
      Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 27/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 23/09/2020).
      The reported R values have been predominantly greater than 1 since the second week in September.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.

     As of 27/09/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,458
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,113 (69%) are occupied, and 9,345 (31%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     General assessment
     At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
     dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
     worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
     beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased markedly. Many of these cases were
     associated with travellers. Since calendar week 35 transmissions within Germany can be observed to a
     larger extent. Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in
     connection with celebrations with family and friends and at group events. There are still no approved
     vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
     The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
     very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
     the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
     measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
     play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
     indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m is
     maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained,
     e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of
     transmission outdoors.
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
     individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
     previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
     Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
     main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
