    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown in 60.300 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
    on gender was reported, 5,350 were children under 10 years of age (2.7%), 9,873 children and teenagers
    aged 10 to 19 years (4.9%), 88.117 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 60,104 persons aged 50 to 69
    years (30%), 30,461 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,386 persons aged 90 years and older
    (2.7%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 435 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48 years
    (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (15/07/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 170,520 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,141 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 4,042 of 27,015 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,821 (17%) of 174,221 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 186,000 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,071 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.5% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 5,011 (55%) are men and 4,055 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,763 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

   COVID-19 Situation Report 15/07/2020
6
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
    care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
    persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
    female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
    among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
    reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Countries of Exposure
    Borders have begun to open since reporting week 25, initially in Europe. Since then, among the
    countries reported as the probable place of exposure, the proportion of countries other than Germany
    has increased. This proportion peaked at 58% (2,970 cases) in reporting week 11, after which it rapidly
    decreased in association with the implemented travel restrictions to 0.6% (19 cases) in week 20. As of
    week 21 there is a slight increase, which is now at 16% (222 cases) in week 28.
    Table 4 lists the countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks 25 to 28
    (countries mentioned in at least 5 cases) from total 8.982 numbers mentioned

      Outbreaks
      A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in one district:
      the district of Bad Toelz-Wolfrathshausen (Bavaria).
      In this district a higher incidence of of cases was observed in two refugee facilities. Appropriate
      containment measures were implemented.
      The 7-day incidence in thedistrict of Guetersloh that had been caused by an outbreak in a meat
      processing plant had been steadily decreasing and has now sunk below 25 cases per 100,000
      inhabitants.
      A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
      well as religious communities.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 44 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

      A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
      estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
      This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
      outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
      affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to

      relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the case in
      Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.02 (95%-prediction interval: 0.81 – 1.24) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 15/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-
      day average of the nowcasting curve. This compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value
      represents a slightly later course of infection of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-
      value is estimated at 0.95 (95% prediction interval: 0.85 – 1.06) and is based on electronically notified
      cases as of 15/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 15/07/2020, a total of 1,273 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,520
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,489 (66%) are occupied, and 11,031 beds (34%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in 5.

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
      well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
      are transmitted via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses
      (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the

       Up to and including week 27, 228 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
       one of the other transmitting networks and communicate mainly on a weekly basis.
       Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
       the numbers determined will increase subsequently. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
       the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
       German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.

      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
      capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
      burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
