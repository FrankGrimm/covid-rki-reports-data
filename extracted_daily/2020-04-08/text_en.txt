Summary (as of 08/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    In total, 103,228 COVID-19 cases and 1,861 deaths due to COVID-19 have been electronically
     reported to the Robert Koch Institute in Germany.

     equally affected.
    86% of deaths, but only 16% of all cases, occurred in persons aged 70 years or older.
    Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes and hospitals are increasing. In
     some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively high.
    As of March 23/2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and
     household members) were banned in all states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with
     body care were closed.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 103,228 (+4,003) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 1,861 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and

    Germany by county and federal state (08/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health
    authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 39,928 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 52% are male and 48% are female. Among notified cases, there are 804 children under
    5 years of age, 2,020 children aged 5 to 14 years, 71,793 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 19,935 aged 60 to
    79 years and 8,475 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 201 notified cases is
    unknown. The median age of cases is 49 years.

    information available (08/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 77,538 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are
    cough (52%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 1,779 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 11,477 (15%) of 77,571 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 46,300 persons are estimated to have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. The
    algorithm to estimate the number of recoveries has been adapted. It now includes cases with and without
    known date of onset.
    The 1,861 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 1,151 (62%) men and 706 (38%)
    women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 105 years. Of all deaths, 1,607 (86%) were in
    persons 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age group. Reports on COVID-19 related
    outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively
    high.

    Estimation of the reproduction number (R0)
    The reproduction number, R0, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R0 can only be estimated
    and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R0= 1.2 (95% confidence
    interval: 0.9-1.6) and is based on current electronically notified cases (08/04/2020 12:00 AM) and an
    assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were

      excluded from the estimation as their low number due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable
      estimate.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    International risk areas
      -     The following countries and regions are classified as international risk areas (31/03/2020)
            (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete.html):
                 o Austria
                 o Egypt
                 o France
                 o Iran
                 o Italy
                 o Netherlands
                 o Spain
                 o Switzerland
                 o South Korea: the city of Daegu and the province of Gyeongsangbuk-do (North-Gyeongsang)
                 o United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
                 o United States of America
      Due to pandemic spread, there is a global risk of acquiring COVID-19. Due to differences in surveillance
      systems, test strategies and reporting delays, the risk of infection cannot always be related to reported
      numbers. Therefore, all persons entering Germany are required to remain in quarantine for 14 days.
