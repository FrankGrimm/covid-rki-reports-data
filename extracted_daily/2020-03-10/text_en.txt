2   COVID-19 Situation Report 10/03/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    Case numbers1
      With over 1,000 cases in Germany, the COVID-19 case numbers can no longer be manually updated and reported
      in a quality assured manner. Therefore, the reporting will be changed. As of today, epidemiological evaluations in
      the COVID-19 situation report will only refer to the electronically transmitted data that are available to the
      Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at the time of the data closure. Until the end of the week, the number of previously
      manually reported cases and the electronically reported cases by state are listed (see Table 1). After that, only
      the electronically transmitted cases will be presented.
      A total of 1,296 (+157) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been detected
      in Germany since 27/01/2020, of which 654 were electronically reported to and validated at the Robert Koch
      Institute. So far, two deaths related to COVID-19 diseases were reported.
      Information on laboratory-confirmed cases
      So far, 1,296 cases in 16 federal states have been laboratory-confirmed (Table 1).

    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 1,296 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 654 cases from 15 states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 654 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (10/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 353 are male (54%) and 301 female (46%). The age range is from 0 to 82 years, including 11
    children under the age of 5, 14 children aged 5-14 and 547 persons in the age groups 15 to 59 years and 76
    persons 60 years and older (see Figure 2). The age of 2 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 41 years.

    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 07/03/2020. In 315 cases, onset of symptoms
    is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as moderate. However, this risk varies from region to
      region and is higher in "particularly affected areas". The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The burden on the health care system depends on the regional
      distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social
      distancing etc.), and may be very high in some regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of
      new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     As of 10/03/2020, the following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:
                 o     District of Heinsberg (North Rhine Westphalia)
      -     As of 10/03/2020, the following regions are classified as risk areas (www.rki.de/covid-19-risikogebiete):
                 o In China: Hubei province (incl. City of Wuhan)
                 o Iran
                 o Italy
                 o In South Korea: The province of Gyeongsangbuk-do (North-Gyeongsang)
