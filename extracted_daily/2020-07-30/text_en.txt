COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
      – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
      Summary (as of 30/07/2020 12:00 AM)
          In the past few weeks, the number of districts that have not reported any COVID-19 cases over a
           period of 7 days has decreased clearly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal
           states. This trend is concerning.
          The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 4.8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
           and thus further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 80 districts transmitted zero
           cases over the past 7 days. Moreover, in 220 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000
           inhabitants.
          In total, 207,828 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,134 deaths due to COVID-19 have
           been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
          In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >150
           cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company. The entire company with over 450
           employees is under quarantine.
          Moreover, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including nursing homes and
           hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, as well as in context of religious or family
           events.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      An increase in COVID-19 case numbers since last week occurred in many of the federal states, but was
      most marked in Bavaria and Northrhine Wetphalia.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case outbreaks in different administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and
      health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning
      from travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since last week. This development is very
      concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also in outdoor
      settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where necessary, wearing a community or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 207,828
      (+902) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 80 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts that have not submitted any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has
      decreased continuously; on 12th July still, the number of districts reporting zero cases was 125.
      Figure 1: Number and cumulative incidence (per 100,000 population) of the 207,828 electronically reported COVID-19 cases in
      Germany by county and federal state (30/07/20220, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
      information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).

  As part of quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices, corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports) can occiasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *The number of cases is lower than the difference to the previous day, because only those cases notified by the health
  authorities within the last 7 days are taken into account.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 64,170 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (30/07/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 6,015 were children under 10 years of age (2.9%), 10,810 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.2%), 92,581 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 61,629 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (30%), 30,911 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,436 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.6%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 476 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48
  years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 176,777 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
  cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,240 cases (3.0%). Since
  calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
  ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
  reported in 4,913 of 32,800 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,556 (17%) of 181,090 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 191,800 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  In total, 9,134 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.4% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,050 (55%) are men and 4,079 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
  five cases.
  The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,809 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only
  18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of
  age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases. Since
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases, the
  proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Five districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts of
  Dingolfing-Landau and Hof in Bavaria, the district of Weimar in Thuringia, the district Solingen in North
  Rhine-Westphalia and the district Dithmarschen in Schleswig-Holstein.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to an outbreak among harvest workers of an agricultural
  company. Among more than 450 employees, >150 SARS-CoV-2-infections were identified. Quarantine
  was ordered for the entire company. The local population (3,300 inhabitants) has been offered
  voluntary testing.

  A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
  Hof (Bavaria). Several events are responsible for this increase. An outbreak in a large family has
  extended to several families in neighbouring communities. Another outbreak is related to a family event
  including individuals from Hof district as well as Weimar district in Thuringia. Together with another
  family-related outbreak, this explains the currently increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases per 100.000
  inhabitants in Weimar district. Due to ongoing screening activites, further cases can be expected.
  Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.
  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 29/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 25/07/2020).
  A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
  estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
  This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
  outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
  affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
  relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
  The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.02 (95%-prediction interval: 0,82 – 1.26) and is based on
  electronically notified cases as of 30/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.17 (95% prediction
     interval: 1,05 – 1.29) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 30/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported 7-day R value has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a
     larger number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

  DIVI intensive care register
     A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
     RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
     number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     As of 30/07/2020, a total of 1,277 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 33,367 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 21,698 (65%) are occupied, and 11,669 beds (35%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Data on emergency department utilisation
      In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/), the RKI
      analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
      https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
      As of 26-07-2020, data from 10 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between 01-11-2019 and
      01-03-2020, an average of 6,608 emergency department admissions per week was recorded. From the middle to
      the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was observed, to 3,969 admissions in week
      13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In
      parallel to the decrease in daily admissions, public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in
      Germany. Subsequently, an increase in admissions has been observed. In week 30 2020, 6,396 admissions were
      recorded. Therefore, the number of admissions is currently 3% below the average of November 2019 to February
      2020 (see Figure 5).

  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for actue respiratory illnesses
      GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
      (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 30, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased
      slightly, but increased among young adults between 15 and 34 years of age. Further information can be
      found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.

       The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
       practices. In week 30, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
       increased slightly. The ARI incidence increased for the age group 15 to 34 years and decreased for the
       age group 0 to 14 years. Overall, it remained at a low level that matches the level of previous season at
       this time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 25 of 33
       sentinel samples (76%) in week 30, 2020. Since week 16, 2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected within
       the viral sentinel surveillance of the AGI. Further information can be found under
       https://influenza.rki.de/.
       A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
       patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
       the lower respiratory tract). In week 29, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable overall,
       but increased for the age groups up to 34 years of age. Numbers decreased for older age groups.
       Overall, the total number of SARI cases remained at a low level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 29,
       2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (See Figure 6). Please note that due to
       data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation
       duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

       code U07.1!) among SARI cases with duration of hospitalisation of up to one week and with date of admission in weeks 12 to
       29, 2020, from 70 sentinel hospitals
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.

     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
     the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
     measures and community masks).
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
