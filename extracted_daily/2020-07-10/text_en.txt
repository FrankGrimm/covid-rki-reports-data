    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 decreased
  from reporting week 26 to 27 in the majority of states. In states with increases, overall incidences reamain
  low. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020
  onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is unknown in 59,614 cases (30%), thus their date of
  reporting is provided in Figure 2.

    on gender was reported, 5,197 were children under 10 years of age (2.6%), 9,726 children and teenagers
    aged 10 to 19 years (4.9%), 87,273 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 59,815 persons aged 50 to 69
    years (30%), 30,369 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,375 persons aged 90 years and older
    (2.7%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 423 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48 years
    (median age 49 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (10/07/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 169,357 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,116 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,851 of 25,926 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,641 (17%) of 172,751 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 184,000 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,054 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 5,003 (55%) are men and 4,046 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,750 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
    care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
    persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
    female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
    among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
    reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 10/07/2020

      Outbreaks
      A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
      Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia).
      The high but slowly decreasing 7-day incidence in this district is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
      plant. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The first employees were
      discharged from quarantine 14 days after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 hours after
      resolution of symptoms.
      A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
      well as religious communities.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 44 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

      Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 10/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 06/07/2020).
      A sensitive R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
      estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
      This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
      outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
      possibly exposed persons, leading to therapid detection of large numbers of additional COVID-19 cases.
      This can lead to relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the
      case in Germany - the total number of new cases is small.

      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.80 (95%-prediction interval: 0.65 – 0.99) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 10/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-
      day average of the nowcasting curve. This compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value
      represents a slightly later course of infection of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-
      value is estimated at 0.90 (95% prediction interval: 0.80 – 1.00) and is based on electronically notified
      cases as of 10/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 10/07/2020, a total of 1,270 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,298
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,208 (65%) are occupied, and 11,090 beds (35%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Mortality Monitoring
       A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
       excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
       the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
       (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data,
       have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
       monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
       All-cause mortality for the countries in the EuroMOMO network have now returned to normal levels,
       following a period of a substantial excess mortality coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. A few
       countries are still seeing some excess mortality. Excess mortality was observed primarily in the age
       group of over-65s, but also in the age group of 15-64s.
       Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with
       a certain time lag (currently 07/06/2020). A special evaluation on excess mortality is updated every two
       weeks: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
       Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German). Looking at the
       development by months, in March 2020 there is no noticeable increase in the number of deaths
       compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, the mortality figures were significantly
       above the average of previous years; since the beginning of May, the mortality figures have been back
       to around the average.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
