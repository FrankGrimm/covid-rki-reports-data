2   COVID-19 Situation Report 23/03/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 00 AM, each day). As not all local health authorities
      were able to transmit data on the week-end and due to some technical problems, the true increase in
      case numbers is higher than presented here. Outstanding data will be transmitted today.
      Since 27/01/2020, a total of 22,672(+4,062) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 86 deaths. (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and

4   COVID-19 Situation Report 23/03/2020
      Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 21/03/2020. In 10,142 cases, onset of
      symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 3).

      symptoms and alternatively by date of reporting. (23/03/2020, 12:00 AM)
      Further information
      The 86 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 54 men and 32 women.
      Median age was 83 years; 66 deaths (77%) were in persons 80 years of older.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as high. However, this risk varies from region to region.
      The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The
      burden on the health care system depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and
      initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some
      regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     The following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:
                 o     District of Heinsberg (North Rhine Westphalia) since 12/03/2020
      -     All federal states are implementing measures to enforce social distancing, such as cancellation of mass
            gatherings, closure of cultural institutions such as museums, theaters, concert halls, limiting operation of
            restaurants, bars and clubs, as well as school and daycare closures starting the week of 16/03/2020.
      -     Bavaria and the Saarland have decreed a limited curfew.
