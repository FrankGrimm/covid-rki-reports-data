COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 18/07/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus increased slightly at a low level. A total of 105 districts transmitted zero cases. Moreover,
          in 240 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5,0/100,000 inhabitants.
     •    In total, 201,372 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,083 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    Currently, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including meat-processing plants,
          facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, nursing homes and hospitals as well as in context of
          families or religious events.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 201,372
      (+529) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been electronically
      reported to and validated by the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 105 districts reported no cases in the past 7
      days. Information on laboratory-confirmed cases is also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and https://corona.rki.de.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 61,072 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (18/07/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Approximately 187,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  In total, 9,083 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.5% of all confirmed cases).
  So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-
  existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
  the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
  female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
  among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
  reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
  persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
  Bad Toelz-Wolfrathshausen (Bavaria). Here a higher incidence of of cases was observed in two refugee
  facilities. Appropriate containment measures were implemented.
  A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.

    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 18/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 14/07/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the case in
    Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.42 (95%-prediction interval: 1.07 – 1.76) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 18/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.34 (95% prediction
    interval: 1.14 – 1.54) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 18/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
    R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
    also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

     COVID-19 Situation Report 18/07/2020

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
      transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
      German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
      short notice based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
      behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
      capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
      burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
