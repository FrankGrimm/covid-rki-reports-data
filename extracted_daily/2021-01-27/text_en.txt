      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

     Summary (as of 27/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
     • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the
          health of the general population as very high.
     • Yesterday, 13,198 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 982 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 101 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,
          Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
     • Of 412 districts, 380 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 184 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000
          population and of these, 7 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
     • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 80 and of people ≥80 years 208 cases/100,000 population.
     • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
     • On 27/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,501 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +549 existing patients
          had been discharged (31% of whom had died) and +479 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was -70 more than the prior day.
     • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,672,215 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.0%) and
          318,674 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 27/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of
  COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to decrease in almost all regions.
  The R-value is currently below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this
  means still a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in
  nursing and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many
  districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the
  number of serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a medical mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially
  indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide, for which both their effect on
  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations are being examined in detail. Since mid-
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. By now there is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. Currently there is no evidence that infections with variant B.1.1.7 lead to
  more serious diseases. At least for the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty by BioNTech/Pfizer, an effectiveness
  against B.1.1.7 could be shown in first studies.
  Also in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. The
  effectiveness of vaccines is currently being tested for this variant as well. Furthermore, a SARS-CoV-2
  variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of Amazonas.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data
  acquisition in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection
  process is increasingly monitored by integrated molecular surveillance.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data
  transmission to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported
  incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,161,275
  (+13,198) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *In Brandenburg. some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by
  the RKI. ** Due to a technical problem today, there has been a difference of four cases between the Dashboard and case
  numbers given here. These problems are currently being resolved.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 1,143,490 cases (53 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (27/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 26/01/2021, a total of 1,279 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,974 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 22,770 (84%) are occupied, and 4,204 (16%) beds are currently available.
     The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well
     as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data
     are ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
     survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
     Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
     the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
     Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 3/2021, 38,533,736 PCR-laboratory
     tests have been recorded to date, 2,249,854 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
     Up to and including week 3/2021, 258 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or
     in one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis.
     Since laboratories can register and correct the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is
     possible that the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number
     of tests is not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of
     individual patients (Table 3) Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.with data for the last
     10 weeks – complete data since beginning of testing are available at http://www.rki.de/covid-19-
     testzahlen (in German).
     As testing criteria were adapted to the current situation of limited testing capacities in face of high case
     numbers and to take into account the common cold season, from week 46 onwards the proportion of
     positive tests cannot be compared directly to former weeks (Adapted testing criteria:

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the
     general population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2
     transmission as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and
     nursing and senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable
     groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections
     can be reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the
     new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

  Annex
     1
       The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former
     cases may be included.
     2
       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
     number of recovered cases.
     3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and
     hospitalization but not for late effects because such data were not recorded regularly.
     4
       Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are
     reported.
