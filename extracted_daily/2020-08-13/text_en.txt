COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 13/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal states and the number of
             districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased markedly. This trend is
             concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 7.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus further increased. A total of 39 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a
             further 195 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In North-Rhine Westphalia, Hamburg, Berlin and Hesse the 7-day incidences increased rapidly over
             the past few weeks and are markedly higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 219,964 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,211 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau two COVID-19 related outbreaks occurred with almost
             500 cases among harvest workers of an agricultural company and among employees of a canning
             company.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, meat-processing plants
             and other occupational settings, educational settings, among travellers and in the context of
             religious or family events.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. A high proportion of cases is reported due to travellers.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many smaller outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in
      various settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, educational and occupational settings,
      but also in community and health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified
      among travellers entering Germany.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also in
      outdoor settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community or face mask
      correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 219,964
      (+1,445) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 39 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past
      few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
      decreased continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 70,866 cases (32%), thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 2.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (13/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 6,989 were children under 10 years of age (3.2%), 12,610 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.7%), 99,240 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 63,631 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (29%), 31,454 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,508 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.5%). The age and/or gender was unknown in 532 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 47
  years (median age 47 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (13/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 185,422 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (47%), fever (39%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,337
  cases (2.9%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance
  category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two
  symptoms was reported in 6,129 of 41,185 cases (15%).

  Hospitalisation was reported for 31,365 (16%) of 191,060 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status. Approximately 199,500 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection.
  Since the exact date of recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this
  number.
  A total of 9,211 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.2% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,102 (55%) are men and 4,105 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,873 (85%)
  were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Thus far, three
  deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing
  medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases. Since
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases, the
  proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
  education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the
  number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat
  processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Seven districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the district
  of Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, the district of Berlin-Mitte in Berlin, the city of Ludwigshafen in
  Rhineland-Paltinate, and the district of Unna and the cities of Hagen, Duisburg and Bochum in
  Northrhine Westphalia.
  In the district of Dingolfing-Landau the 7-day incidence has now fallen below 100 cases per 100,000
  inhabitants. The increased incidence is due to two outbreaks with together close to 500 COVID-19-cases,
  one among harvest workers of an agricultural company and the other –currently responsible for the
  continued high incidence - among employees in two of three locations of a canning company.
  Quarantine was ordered for all employees of both companies. The local population (3,300 inhabitants)

  has been offered voluntary testing. No transmission into the local population has been detected thus
  far.
  In the cities of Duisburg, Ludwigshafen, Hagen and Bochum as well as the districts of Unna and Berlin-
  Mitte, cases detected among travellers entering Germany play an important role in the observed high 7-
  day incidence.
  Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  educational settings, meat-processing plants and other occupational settings, in the context of family
  events and religious communities as well as among travellers.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.
  Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 13/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 09/08/2020).
  A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
  estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
  This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
  outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
  affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
  relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
  The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.91 (95%-prediction interval: 0.71 – 1.09) and is based on
  electronically notified cases as of 13/08/2020, 12:00 AM.

     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.06 (95% prediction
     interval: 0.95 – 1.19) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 13/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is associated with a
     larger number of small outbreaks, but also with case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures and due to an increased number of travel
     returnees.

  DIVI intensive care register
     A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
     RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
     number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     As of 13/08/2020, a total of 1,274 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
     30,389 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,826 (72%) are occupied, and 8,563 (28%) are
     currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

   Data on emergency department utilisation
       In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
       the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
       https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html
       As of 09/08/2020, data from 10 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between
       01/11/2019 and 01/03/2020, an average of 6,608 emergency department admissions per week were
       recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was
       observed, to 3,969 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable
       surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions,
       public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase
       in admissions has been observed. In week 32 2020, 6,071 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the
       number of admissions is currently 8% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see
       Figure 5).
       Figure 5: Number of emergency department attendances in Germany, from November 2019 to July 2020; 7-day moving

   Information on additional RKI-based surveillance
   systems for acute respiratory illnesses
       GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
       (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 32, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased
       slightly. Additional microbiological surveillance (Grippe-Web-Plus-2020) was established at the end of
       March 2020. A random subsample of regular GrippeWeb participants was provided with material for
       self-swabbing from the RKI, where all samples will be tested for 21 different respiratory pathogens,
       including influenza viruses and SARS-COV-2. So far, 251 samples have been sent to the RKI, comprising
       samples from baseline testing at the beginning of the surveillance period and samples taken in the

       presence of respiratory symptoms. None of the samples has tested positive for influenza virus or SARS-
       COV-2. Since week 12, 2020, 72 samples were received from participants with respiratory symptoms.
       Respiratory pathogens were detected in 15 (21 %) of these samples, the majority rhinoviruses and
       enteroviruses. Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
       The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
       practices. In week 32, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
       decreased. The ARI incidence decreased in nearly all age groups but increased in the age group 35 to 59
       years. Overall, it remained at a low level, similar to the level of previous seasons at this time of the year.
       Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 9 of 18 sentinel samples (50%) in
       week 32, 2020. Since week 16, 2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected within the viral sentinel
       surveillance of the AGI. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
       A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
       patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
       the lower respiratory tract). In week 31, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased. Of all reported
       SARI cases in week 31, 2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (See Figure 6).
       Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main
       diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.
       Figure 4: Weekly number of SARI cases (ICD-10 codes J09-J22) and proportion of cases with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10
       code U07.1!) among SARI cases with duration of hospitalisation of up to one week and with date of admission in weeks 12 to
       31, 2020, from 70 sentinel hospitals
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
       again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
       available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
       as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.

     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
     the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
     measures and community masks).
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
