COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 21/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly in many federal states and the
             number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased
             considerably. This trend is very concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus remains at an increased level. A total of only 25 districts transmitted zero cases over the
             past 7 days. In further 120 districts the 7-day-incidence is equal or below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Hesse, Bavaria and North Rhine Westphalia the 7-day incidence is considerably higher, in
             Rhineland – Palatinate, Berlin and Baden-Wuerttemberg slightly higher than the national mean 7-
             day-incidence. Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia have been showing declining values since the
             beginning of the week.
        •    In total, 230,048 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,260 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    The new cases are distributed nationwide and occur increasingly among travellers but also in the
             context of events with family and friends.
        •    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing
             homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-
             processing plants, agricultural and other occupational settings, as well as in the context of religious
             events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 21/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. It is noticeable that the average age of infection has decreased over the past few
      weeks, that the incidence particularly in younger age groups has increased and is much higher than in
      older age groups.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many small outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger events with family and friends. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases
      are being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and increasing in dynamic. A further worsening of the situation must be avoided. On
      the one hand, the increase in younger age groups needs to be stopped, on the other hand, transmission
      into older and vulnerable groups needs to be prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises
      among elderly people, hospitalisations and number of deaths will likely rise as well. This can only be
      prevented if the entire population continues to be committed to decreasing transmission, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also outdoors -, by airing indoor areas
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community or face mask correctly. Large gatherings – especially
      indoors – should be avoided, and events with family and friends should be limited to close family
      members and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Since January 2020, a total of 230,048 (+1,427) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been
      electronically reported to and validated by the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 25 districts
      reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any
      COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days decreased continuously; on 12/07/2020 the number of districts
      reporting zero cases still amounted to 125 districts.
      Figure 1: Number and cumulative incidence (per 100,000 population) of the 230,048 electronically reported COVID-19 cases in
      Germany by county and federal state (21/08/2020, 00:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
      information on number of COVID-19 cases by district (local health authority).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 76,968 cases (33%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (21/08/2020, 12:00 AM).

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 7,727 were children under 10 years of age (3.4%), 14,185 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.2%), 105,207 persons aged 20 to 49 years (46%), 65,000 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (28%), 31,756 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,536 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.4%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 637 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 46 years
  (median age 46 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (21/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 192,240 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (46%), fever (39%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,390 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 7.284 of 47,930 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 31.829 (16%) of 199,154 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 205,800 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,260 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.0% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,130 (55%) are men and 4,126 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,918 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in
  meat processing plants.

    COVID-19 Situation Report 21/08/2020

    Outbreaks
    Nine districts reported an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants, including the
    city of Offenbach in Hesse with an incidence of >50 cases/ 100.000 inhabitants in the past 7 days. The
    federal states mainly affected are Hesse and Bavaria. The increased incidence in the affected districts is
    mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad but also in the context of family events and
    other private events.
    The high incidence in the district of Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, caused by an outbreak on an
    agricultural farm with an attached canning factory is decreasing and dropped below the value of 25
    cases/ 100.000 inhabitants.
    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings, including nursing
    homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-processing
    plants, agricultural and other occupational settings, as well as in the context of religious events.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

     affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
     relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
     The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.02 (95%-prediction interval: 0.81 – 1.26) and is based on
     electronically notified cases as of 21/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.12 (95% prediction
     interval: 1,00 – 1.26) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 21/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. According to current
     observations, this seems to be associated to a great extent with an increasing number of cases among
     travel returnees, a larger number of smaller outbreaks and the overall case numbers in Germany, which
     have increased steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of disease control measures.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 21/08/2020

  Mortality Monitoring
      A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
      excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
      the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
      (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data,
      have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
      monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
      An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
      April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also
      among those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the
      Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. All-cause mortality for the countries in the
      EuroMOMO network has now largely returned to expected levels.
      Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with
      a certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
      https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
      Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
      Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
      of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
      significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
      of May. In calendar week 29, 2020 (19.07. - 25.07.) 16,112 people died (+42 compared to the week 28);
      the number of deaths for this calendar week is thus approx. 1% below the average of the previous years
      2016-2019.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
      mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with a clear
      acceleration in recent weeks. At the same time, the number of districts that have not reported any cases
      in the last 7 days is decreasing. There are larger and smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in
      connection with celebrations in the circle of family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees,
      especially in the younger age groups, also contribute to the increase in the number of cases. Vaccines
      and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of
      the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
      short notice based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
      play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
      indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
      is maintained.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

9                                                                                                                    9
    If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not maintained, e.g. when
    groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased risk of transmission
    outdoors.
    Disease severity
    In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
    increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
    individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
    previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
    Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
    Burden on health system
    The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
    care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
    large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
    system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
