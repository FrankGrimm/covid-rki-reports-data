    North Rhine-Westphalia and other federal states contracted infection with SARS-CoV-2. Among cases with a
    history of travel to Italy, an increasing number reported South Tyrol as the probable place of exposure.
    In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states. Current figures on confirmed cases
    are available on the RKI website at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html
    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 902 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 447 cases from 14 states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 447 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (08/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 249 are male (56%) and 198 female (43%). The age range is from 2 to 80 years, including 10
    children under the age of 5, 10 children aged 5-14 and 373 persons in the age groups 15 to 59 years and 51
    persons 60 years and older (see Figure 2). The age of 3 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 40 years.

      Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 06/03/2020. In 204 cases, onset of symptoms
      is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

      alternatively by date of reporting (08/03/2020)
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal courses occur in
      some cases. Further cases, chains of infections and clusters within Germany can be expected. Therefore the risk
      to the German general population due to COVID-19 is currently considered to be moderate. A global spread of
      the pathogen is increasingly likely. This assessment may change as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
