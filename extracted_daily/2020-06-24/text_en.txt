    cases with information available (24/06/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 163,813 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 4,975 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,031 of 20,872 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 28,943 (18%) of 166,249 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 176,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,717 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in six districts,
    primarily due to localised outbreaks: The districts of Guetersloh and the neighbouring districts of
    Warendorf and Hamm (all North Rhine-Westphalia), the district of Goettingen (Lower Saxony), and the
    city district Berlin-Friedrichshain (city district of Berlin).

     COVID-19 Situation Report 24/06/2020

      The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
      plant. More than one thousand employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was
      temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are being quarantined as well as their household
      members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the district have been closed since 18th of June
      until the end of the summer holidays (11th of August 2020s). On June 23, 2020, the state of North Rhine-
      Westphalia officially activated the second stage of a lockdown for the district of Guetersloh until June
      30, 2020. The 7-day high incidence in Warendorf and Hamm is linked to the outbreak in Guetersloh.
      Employees of the meat processing company are residents of neighbouring districts. In the affected
      region, testing for coronavirus is being significantly expanded. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in
      the food retail sector, kiosk staff and residents of central shared accommodation will be tested in
      Gütersloh and Warendorf. The population can have a test performed free of charge. There have also
      been and still are outbreaks in meat processing plants in other federal states, some of which have led to
      production closures.
      A large COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the district of Goettingen, in the context of highly crowded
      housing conditions. All inhabitants of one large apartment complex have been quarantined, control- and
      support measures are being carried out along with extensive testing. Additionally, an outbreak in a
      refugee facility is reported, affecting more than 20 people.
      In Neukölln, a district of Berlin, an outbreak is linked to members of a religious community. So far, more
      than one hundred cases can be linked to this outbreak. The infected persons live in predominantly
      cramped conditions, the entire block of flats has been quarantined.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.
                                                                                Cases:                       Symptom onset reported

7                                                                                                                     7
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0,72 (95%-prediction interval: 0,56 – 0,91)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 24/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.17 (95% predictation
      interval: 1.08 – 1.25) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 24/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      The estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) have decreased to a value of 1 or
      below. The strongly increased values in the past few days are related to local accumulations, which are
      described in the section "Outbreaks", with the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly
      important role. The dynamics of the various outbreak events are also influenced in part by serial tests
      carried out in the scope of the detected outbreaks, which can promptly lead to the detection of further
      infected persons. For this reason, the reproduction figures may continue to fluctuate strongly. Since the
      case numbers in Germany are at a low level overall, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong
      influence on the value of the reproduction number.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020)
  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 24/06/2020, a total of 1,261 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,154
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 17,718 (65%) are occupied, and 9.436 beds (35%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      In order to assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as
      well as clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These
      are transmitted via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, via the network for respiratory viruses
      (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the
      Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory
      medicine.

       Since laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that
       the numbers determined will increase subsequently. It should be noted that the number of tests is not
       the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of patients (see
       Table 5).
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
