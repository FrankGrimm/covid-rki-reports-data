COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 29/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire
     population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 99 cases per 100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
     incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 63.7 cases/100.000 population.
 • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland is higher than the national
     total 7-day incidence.
 • The number of districts with an increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants continues to rise, to 395 urban
     and rural districts. Of these, 139 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and 175 districts have an
     incidence of >50-100 cases/100,000 population. 15 districts have an incidence of >200 cases/100,000 population.
 • A number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are being reported
     particularly in the context of private meetings, celebrations and group events with case clusters also being reported in
     nursing homes.
 • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has more than doubled in the past 2 weeks from 655 patients on
     15/10/2020 to 1,696 patients on 29/10/2020.
 • In total, 481,013 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,272 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
     to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 29/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values have been stable
      since the beginning of October, well above 1. Since the beginning of this week, a slight downward trend
      has been observed.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 481,013
  (+16,774) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 29/10/2020

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 210,171 cases (46%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (29/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 43% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 395 districts,
  including 139 urban and rural districts with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 175
  districts with a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in the context of celebrations
  with family and friends. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large
  increases in the affected districts. However, many small outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, and community facilities, kindergartens and
  schools, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to
  the increase of incidence.

       Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
       The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
       R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
       extracted from the notification system.
                                           4-day R-value                                                               7-day R-value
                                                0.97                                                                        1.17

       Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
       less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
       As of 29/10/2020, a total of 1,284 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 29,344
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,785 (74%) are occupied, and 7,559 (26%) are currently
       available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
      systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 42, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased.
     Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/. GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web
     interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI), utilizing information from
     the population. In week 43, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased. The ARI rate has been below
     the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Additional microbiological surveillance (GrippeWeb-
     Plus-2020) was established at the end of March 2020. A random subsample of regular GrippeWeb
     participants was provided with material for self-swabbing from the RKI, where all samples will be tested
     for 21 different respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses and SARS-COV-2. So far, 299 samples
     have been sent to the RKI, comprising samples from baseline testing at the beginning of the surveillance
     period and samples taken in the presence of respiratory symptoms. None of the samples has tested
     positive for influenza virus so far. Since week 13, 2020, 119 samples were received from participants
     with respiratory symptoms. Respiratory pathogens were detected in 52 (44%) of these samples, the
     majority rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (87%). In week 43, 2020, SARS-COV-2 was detected in a sample
     of GrippeWeb-Plus-2020 for the first time. Further information can be found under
     https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 43, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) increased. The number of patients visits due to ARI increased in most of the age groups, but
     decreased further in children aged 5 to 14 years. Overall, it still remained at a similar level to that of
     previous seasons at this time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was
     detected in 11 of 28 sentinel samples (39%) in week 43, 2020, whereas SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus
     was detected in none of the analyzed samples. Further information can be found under
     https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 42, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable. Overall,
     the number of SARI cases remained at a similar level to that of previous years, but was below the usual
     level for children aged below 15 years.

    Of all reported SARI cases in week 42, 2020, 20% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!)
    (see Figure 3). The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI cases in week 42, 2020, can be found
    in Figure 4. This proportion was highest in the age group 35 to 59 years (46%). Please note that due to
    data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation
    duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.
