COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 29/08/202012:00 AM)
        •    Since calendar week 35 the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has slightly decreased after a rise between
             calendar week 29 and 34. The number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7
             days has slightly increased again. Although case numbers have started to decrease in some states,
             the development over the past weeks remains concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
             total of 26 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 133 districts the 7-day-
             incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse and Bremen the 7-day incidence is considerably higher, in
             Berlin slightly higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 240,986 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,289 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, educational settings,
             various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among
             travellers.

       COVID-19 Situation Report 29/08/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can still be observed in Baden-
    Wuerttemberg, Bavaria and Bremen, while the 7-day incidence has decreased in some federal states. It is
    noticeable that the average age of infection decreased over the past few weeks and that the 7-day
    incidence particularly in younger age groups has increased and is much higher than in older age groups.
    Nationwide, there are reports of many small outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various
    settings, such as larger events with family and friends. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases are
    being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups.
    A further increase of case numbers must be avoided. On the one hand, the increase in younger age groups
    needs to be curbed; on the other hand, transmission into older and vulnerable groups needs to be
    prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises among elderly people, hospitalisations and number of
    deaths will likely rise again. This can only be prevented if the entire population continues to be committed
    to decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also
    outdoors -, by airing indoor areas and, where indicated, by wearing a community or face mask correctly.
    Large gatherings, especially indoors, should be avoided, and events with family and friends should be
    limited to close family members and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 240,986
    (+1,479) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (see Table 1). A total of 26 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks, the
    number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has increased again;
    however on 12/07/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 125 districts.
       Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 83,331 cases (35%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  Clinical aspects
  Approximately 214,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,289 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.9% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,145 (55%) are men and 4,140 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years).

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 3).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  In 15 districts an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants was reported. The
  federal states mainly affected are Hesse, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. The increased incidence in
  the affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but also to
  transmission in family and other private events.
  In the city of Wiesbaden in Hesse, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among wedding guests, resulting in
  transmission into the communities, including schools and work places.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.

  Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 29/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 25/08/2020).
  A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
  estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
  This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
  outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
  affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
  relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
  The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.04 (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 - 1.24) and is based on
  electronically notified cases as of 29/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
  Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
  compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
  of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.01 (95% prediction
  interval: 0.90 – 1.13) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 29/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
  The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020 and are around 1 since the beginning of
  this week. This was probably associated with an increasing number of cases among travel returnees,
  especially during school holidays, as well as a larger number of smaller outbreaks and the overall
  increased case numbers in Germany over recent weeks.

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
      mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with a clear
      acceleration in recent weeks; it seems to have stabilized in the last few days. At the same time, the
      number of districts that have not reported any cases in the last 7 days is slightly increasing again after a
      marked decrease. There are larger and smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in connection with
      celebrations in the circle of family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the
      younger age groups, also contribute to the increase in the number of cases. Vaccines and anti-viral
      therapeutics are currently not available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German
      population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice
      based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
      play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
      indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
      is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
      maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
      risk of transmission outdoors.
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
      individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
      previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
      Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
      care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
      large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
      system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
