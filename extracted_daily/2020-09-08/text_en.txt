COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

        Summary (as of 08/09/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    After a high increase between calendar week 29 and 34, the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has slightly
             decreased in calendar week 35. Even if the number of new cases does not increase significantly at
             the moment, the situation must still be carefully monitored.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
             total of 23 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 140 districts the 7-day-
             incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg and Hesse the 7-day incidence is in
             part considerably higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
        •    In total, 252,298 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,329 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, educational settings,
             various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among
             travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 08/09/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of the WHO 1 and the ECDC², the RKI evaluates all laboratory
    diagnostic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 cases, regardless of the presence or severity of the clinical
    symptoms. In the following report, "COVID-19 cases" thus includes both acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and
    COVID-19 diseases.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July has now stabilized at a slightly higher level. The
    R-value is currently around 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks more young people have become
    infected, thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
    situations, e.g. larger celebrations in the family and among friends. In addition, COVID-19 cases are
    identified to a large extent among travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups.
    The current development is positive, but must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the
    proportion of deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of
    younger people among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A
    renewed increase in new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a
    renewed increase among the elderly and particularly among vulnerable groups of the population, as was
    the case at the beginning of the pandemic. If more elderly people become infected again, a renewed
    increase in hospitalizations and deaths must be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 252,298
    (+1,499) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 23 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on
    16/06/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
   transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
   onset of symptoms is unknown for 89,358 cases (35%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

   unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (08/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Demographic distribution of cases
   Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
   and gender were reported, 9,187 were children under 10 years of age (3.6%), 17,417 children and
   teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.9%), 118,653 persons aged 20 to 49 years (47%), 68,252 persons aged
   50 to 69 years (27%), 32,407 persons aged 70 to 89 years (13%) and 5,596 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.2%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 786 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 45 years
  (median age 44 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  weeks 10 to 36 (08/09/2020, 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cases is depicted by the red line.
  The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 4 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
  the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
  proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
  from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
  cases. This development continued in the following weeks. In comparison, the proportion of cases in the
  younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
  decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
  a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations, but as of week 32 the proportion of cases among 10 to 29
  year olds has increased. After the absolute number of cases has been increasing since week 29, they
  have stabilized with a slight downward trend since week 34.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 208,641 (83%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (44%), fever (37%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,531 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 10,043 of 64,155 cases (16%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 32,816 (15%) of 217,578 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.

   * Data not yet meaningful, as outcome of the diseases in these weeks is still unclear
   Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The highest mean age
   of COVID-19 cases as well as the highest proportions of hospitalized patients and deaths were reported
   in weeks 16/17 and have been decreasing since. From week 29 to 34, the weekly number of total cases
   has been increasing, since then a slight decrease is visible. The aforementioned trends are continuing.
  Approximately 226,500 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,329 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.7% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,171 (55%) are men and 4,154 (45%) are women (Table 3), the gender is unknown in four
   cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,961 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 15% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, two deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI.
   Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

   Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
   Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
   care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
   The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
   outbreaks in meat processing plants.
   Possible countries of exposure
   Of the 252,298 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
   81,149 (32%) cases.
   In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country
   as place of exposure and thereby the highest so far. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in reporting week 19 as a
   result of travel restrictions. Borders have reopened, initially in Europe, as of reporting week 25. Since
   then, the proportion of cases reporting a probable country of infection abroad has markedly increased.
   In reporting week 34 it was at 49% and since then the proportion is declining again, to currently 32%
  (Figure 5). In weeks 33-36, 14,440 persons reported a possible site of infection abroad, naming a total of
  14,523 countries (more than one country specified in some cases).
   Figure 5: Presentation of the cases with probable place of infection abroad compared to all other cases (exposure in Germany
   and place of exposure unknown) and the proportion of cases with exposure abroad, in reporting week 10 to 36, 2020
   (08/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
   Table 5 lists the top 15 countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks
   33 to 36. The Western Balkan countries, as well as Turkey, Spain, Romania, France and Bulgaria were
   most frequently reported as the country of exposure. In week 36, Italy and Hungary were also
   frequently mentioned as the country of infection. When looking at the different age groups (not shown),
   it is noticeable that a larger proportion of the cases in Kosovo, Turkey and Romania are children, which
   indicates that they are travelling with their families. On the other hand, in the cases with probable
   country of infection Croatia and Hungary, it is mainly persons between 20-29 years of age who are
   affected.

  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad has increased significantly in recent
  weeks but has been declining again since the school vacation ended in most federal states (see Figure
  5). Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases can
  be greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and hygiene
  and avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
  immediately. In addition, travellers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
  maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  In 11 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
  the cities of Memmingen, Rosenheim and Landshut were the incidence is > 50 cases / 100,000
  population. Affected are mainly districts in the federal state of Bavaria. The increased incidence in the
  affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but also to
  transmission in family and other private events.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 6 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.

     Figure 6: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
     cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
     electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 08/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 04/09/2020).
     A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
     estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
     This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
     outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
     affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
     relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
     The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.10 (95%-prediction interval: 0.90 – 1.31) and is based on
     electronically notified cases as of 08/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.98 (95% prediction
     interval: 0.87 – 1.09) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 08/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are around 1 or
     below 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers,
     particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number
     of smaller outbreaks.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7-
     day R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values
     can also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
     A detailed description of the methodology is available at
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from

   DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
       As of 08/09/2020, a total of 1,284 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
       30,652 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,764 (71%) are occupied, and 8,888 (28%) are
       currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
       reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
       in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
       dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
       worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
       beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week.
       Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with
       celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age
       groups, have also contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no
       approved vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
       The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
       very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
       play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
       indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
       is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
       maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
       risk of transmission outdoors.
       Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
      individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
      previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
      Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
      Burden on health system
      The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
      main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
      (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
      rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
