      COVID-19 Situation Report 24/06/2021
6
      Figure 4: Weekly number of newly hospitalised SARI cases (ICD-10 codes J09-J22) and proportion of cases with a diagnosis of COVID-
      19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) among SARI cases with date of admission in weeks 12, 2020 to 24, 2021. Data are derived from 72 sentinel
      hospitals.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of the, despite the recent decrease in case numbers, high case numbers of COVID-19 and the
      concerning dynamic of the SARS-CoV-2 variant distribution, the RKI assesses the threat to the health of the
      general population in Germany to be high. It highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2
      as well as the occurrence of many outbreaks, particularly in households, day-care facilities for children and
      increasingly in schools, as well as in occupational settings.
      In light of the increase in variants of concern (VOC), which have higher infectiousness, a rigorous reduction
      of physical contacts, use of protective measures, as well as intensive efforts to contain outbreaks and chains
      of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect people who are
      vulnerable.
      On 15/06/2021, the risk assessment was updated. The current version can be found through the following
      link: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

  Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date that cases are received by the RKI. Due to delays in
        data sharing, cases from previous days may be included in today’s numbers.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of shared cases minus deaths and the estimated number of
        recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimating recovered cases takes into account information on disease onset and
        hospitalisation, but does not do so for late effects since these data are not recorded regularly.
      4
        The number of persons vaccinated once at least once includes all individuals who have received at least
        one dose of the BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or Janssen vaccines.
      5
        Vaccinated fully means: Vaccinated twice with the AstraZeneca or BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, or once
        with the Janssen vaccine, or once with any of the available vaccines for those with a prior COVID-19
        infection.
