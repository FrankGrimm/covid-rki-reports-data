  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 127,584 (+2,486) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 3,254 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and
      https://corona.rki.de.

    Germany by county and federal state (15/04/2020, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 47,305 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 48% are male and 52% are female. Among notified cases, 1,011 were children under 5
    years of age, 2,501 children aged 5 to 14 years, 86,548 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 24,669 persons aged
    60 to 79 years and 12,625 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 230 notified cases is
    unknown. The median age of cases is 50 years.

    information available (15/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 104,218 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are
    cough (51%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 2,416 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 15,613 (16%) of 98,381 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 72,600 persons are estimated to have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. As the
    exact date of recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of
    recovered cases.
    The 3,254 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 1,907 (59%) men and 1,344 (41%)
    women (sex was unknown in 3 cases, age was unknown in 2 cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all
    deaths, 2,809 (87%) were in persons 70 years or older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group.
    Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the
    number of deaths is relatively high.
                                                                    Age groups (years)

    SARS-CoV-2 infections among staff working in medical facilities
    Of notified cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6,058 were reported among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by §23 of the German Protection Against Infection law (IfSG), such as hospitals,
    outpatient clinics and practices, dialysis clinics or outpatient nursing services. Among these cases, 72%
    were female and 28% male. The median age was 42 years. Hospitalisation was reported for 239 (4%) of
    5,639 cases with information on hospitalisation available. There were 7 COVID-19 related deaths among
    medical staff.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R can only be estimated
    and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R= 0.9 (95% confidence
    interval: 0.8-1.1) and is based on an assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Due to public holidays and
    a larger delay in reporting, only electronic notifications until 12/04/2020 were included in the estimation.
    Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were excluded from the estimation as their low number
    due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable estimate. For more details on the methodology
    see Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 (in German)
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html
    DIVI intensive care register
    A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
    RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was set up to document the capacities for intensive care
    as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals.
    As of 15/04/2020, 941 hospitals or departments reported to DIVI to the registry. A total of 23,763
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 13,861 (58%) are occupied and 9,902 beds are currently
    available (Table 3).

    Currently, likely fewer than half of all ICU beds in Germany are captured by the registry. Source:

    Laboratory tests
    Data on SARS-CoV-2 test numbers from university hospitals, research institutions as well as clinical and
    outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are collected and merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    transmitted via an internet-based survey of the RKI via Voxco (RKI test laboratory query), by the network
    for respiratory viruses (RespVir), the antibiotic resistance surveillance established at the RKI or via an
    internal query of a laboratory network.

      In addition to the number of tests carried out, information on daily test capacity is queried. In week 16,
      112 laboratories reported a total capacity of 123,304 tests per day. 109 laboratories provided information
      on their working days per week, which ranged from 5 to 7 working days. Assuming a minimum of 5
      working days per week for laboratories without provided information on working days, a testing capacity
      of at least 730,156 feasible PCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (daily test capacity of the
      respective laboratory x working days, sum of all transmitting laboratories) can be derived. In week 15, 25
      laboratories reported a backlog of 3,423 samples to be processed. 47 laboratories reported delivery
      problems for reagents and, increasingly, for swabs.
      In addition to this aggregated weekly recording of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests, more detailed data on
      SARS-CoV-2 tests have been collected by the laboratories involved in Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
      (ARS) since January 1, 2020. As of 14/04/2020, 39,663 (8.6%) of 458.745 tests have tested positive for
      SARS-COV-2 in 50 laboratories.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    International risk areas
      As of 10/04/2020 countries and regions are not longer classified as international risk areas. Due to
      pandemic spread, there is a global risk of acquiring COVID-19. In a considerable number of countries
