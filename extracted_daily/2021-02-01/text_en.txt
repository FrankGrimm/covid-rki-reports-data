      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

      Summary (as of 01/02/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of
          threat to the health of the general population to be very high.
      • Yesterday, 5,608 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 175 new deaths associated with COVID-19
          were transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 91 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,
          Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
      • In 365 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high. In 149 districts, the 7-day incidence is >100
          cases/100,000 population and in 5 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 72 and of people aged ≥80 years, 175
          cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters
          especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 01/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,322 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +397 existing patients had
          been discharged (43% of whom had died) and +371 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was -26 more than the prior day.
      • Since 01/02/2020 a total of 1,935,356 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate
          2.3%) and 532,562 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 01/02/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI classifies all cases of laboratory
  confirmation via SARS-CoV-2-nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) detection or SARS-CoV-2 isolation as COVID-19
  cases, regardless of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, in the following report the term
  "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers have been slowly decreasing.
  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany, this
  nonetheless means that the number of new infections per day remains high.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number
  of serious cases and deaths remains at a high level. These can only be avoided if all persons prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by wearing a surgical mask or masks marked with N95 or KN95 or FFP2 correctly.
  Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide. Their effect on the spread of SARS-
  CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations on these variants are being examined in detail. Since mid-
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. There is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. There are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with
  variant B.1.1.7 may lead to more severe diseases. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that mRNA
  vaccine efficacy is unlikely to be strongly affected by variant B.1.1.7.
  Also, in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. For this
  virus variant, too, laboratory tests show that the efficacy of the licensed mRNA vaccines is only minimally
  affected. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of
  Amazonas. Travels, which are non-essential, should be avoided – especially due to the circulation of new
  virus mutations.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection process is
  increasingly monitored through integrated molecular surveillance.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,221,971
  (+5,608) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,163,089 cases (52 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (01/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After further case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19

  estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany, this
  nonetheless means that the number of new infections per day remains high.

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
      with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
      with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 01/02/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,907 intensive care
      beds were registered, of which 22,196 (82%) are occupied, and 4,711 (18%) beds are currently available.
      The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
      as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
      senior care homes.
      Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
      is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
      reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-
      CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

 Annex
    1
      The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
    transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
    2
      Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
    number of recovered cases.
    3
      The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
    hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
    4
      Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
    reported.
