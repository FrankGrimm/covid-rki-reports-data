       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because
       such data were not recorded regularly.

      Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are reported.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
       – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
       Summary (as of 19/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
       • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the health of the
           general population as very high.
       • Yesterday, 11,369 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 989 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the
           RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 132 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia
           it is markedly above the national incidence.
       • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 277 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
           32 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
       • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 101 and of people ≥80 years 282 cases/100,000 population.
       • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,
           occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
       • On 19/01/2021, 4,947 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 829 patients had been discharged (30% of whom
           had died) and 773 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 56 less than the prior day.
       • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,195,429 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.4%) and 24,741 people twice
           against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
       • In this situation report, the following additional information is given: detailed epidemiological information by week (age, clinical aspects,
           proportion of hospitalized); possible countries of exposure
       Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 19/01/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of
  COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to decrease slightly; depending on the
  region.
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in
  nursing and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many
  districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
  especially indoors - should be avoided.
  On 19/12/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. To date, it is unknown how the
  new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been
  detected in numerous countries around the world. So far, a few cases of this new variant in Germany
  have been reported to the RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new
  virus variant (B.1.351) detected in South Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility and more
  severe disease. Cases with isolates of this lineage have also been identified sporadically in Germany.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data
  transmission to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported
  incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,052,028
  (+11,369) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *In Brandenburg. some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by
  the RKI.
  ** No data was transmitted from Rhineland-Palatinate two days ago, these cases were forwarded yesterday and have been
  included in today’s statistics.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 1,112,561 cases (54 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (19/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Figure 2: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=1,926,001 cases with respective data
  in the weeks 10 to 53, 2020 and week 01, 2021 (19/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and
  age-specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  After the first wave until reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence remained low and has
  increased steadily starting in younger age-groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups.
  Until the end of 2020 an increase of the 7-day incidence could be seen in all age groups, especially in the
  age groups 80 years and older. In reporting week 2 the incidence decreased slightly.

  Figure 3 displays the percentages of deceased, hospitalized and cases with COVID-19 relevant
  symptoms. The percentage of deaths among cases was less than 1% between week 30 and 41. An
  increasing trend is visible from week 36 onwards. In the weeks 47 to 53 it is between 2.3 and 3.1%. As
  deaths occur on average only 2-3 weeks after infection, further reports of deaths among currently
  reported cases are expected for weeks 52/2020 – 02/2021. The proportion of hospitalized COVID-19
  cases increased from 5% in week 35 to 11% in week 53. The percentage of cases with COVID-19 relevant
  symptoms is since week 38 over 80%. These percentages may equally change due to delayed reporting

  and data corrections. During the summer (weeks 26-36) these proportions were lower at 65% and 77%.
  During that time period returning travelers were increasingly tested, among whom asymptomatic
  infections were detected more frequently. The data on which the figure is based and that were
  published here on previous Tuesdays can be found at: www.rki.de/covid-19-tabelle-klinische-aspekte

  The figures on the first page show the number of deaths reported daily according to date of entry at RKI.
  This may also include cases with a date of death several days in the past. Figure 4 shows the reported
  COVID-19 deaths by calendar week according to the date of death. For recent weeks, further reports of
  deaths among reported cases can be expected.
  A significant increase in the number of deaths was observed since week 37. Of all deaths, 42,287 (89%)
  were among people aged 70 years or older, with a median age of 84 years (Table 3), while this age group
  accounts for only 15% of all cases. Thus far, 13 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have
  been reported to the RKI. Nine of these deaths are validated; these children and adolescents were
  between 0 and 17 years of age, and seven of seven with information in this regard had known pre-existing
  conditions.

  country of exposure was missing in 257,264 (49%) cases.
  The absolute number of cases with exposure abroad was stable after the end of the summer vacation
  period (week 38) to week 45 with an average of 1,700 cases per week.

  Since then, it has decreased to currently 262 cases in week 52, 2020. Since the Christmas holidays, the
  number of cases has risen slightly again, to 910 cases in week 01, 2021 and 989 cases in week 02,2021.
  In weeks 52, 2020 to 02, 2021, a total of 2,555 persons (less than 1% of cases with information) reported
  a possible site of infection abroad.
  Travelers from a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry into Germany must maintain a 10-day
  quarantine unless they have a negative test result from a test taken five days after arrival (for further
  details see https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende).
  Outbreaks
  The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
  homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is
  known to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the
  elevated incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 5), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 6.
                          4-day R-value                                                  7-day R-value
                                0.87                                                            0.87
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.74 – 1.00)                          (95%-prediction interval: 0.81 – 0.92)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means a high number of new infections per day.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 19/01/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,031
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,607 (84%) are occupied, and 4,424 (16%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the
     general population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2
     transmission as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and
     nursing and senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable
     groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections
     can be reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the
     new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:
