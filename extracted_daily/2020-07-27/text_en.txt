COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 27/07/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    In the past few weeks, the number of districts that have not submitted any COVID-19 cases over a
          period of 7 days has decreased continuously. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many
          federal states. This situation is worrying.
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 4.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus increased slightly at a low level. A total of 88 districts transmitted zero cases over the
          past 7 days. Moreover, in 236 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5,0/100,000 inhabitants.
     •    In total, 205,609 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,118 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with 174 cases
          among harvest workers of an agricultural company. The entire company with over 450 employees
          is under quarantine.
     •    Currently, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including meat-processing plants,
          facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, nursing homes and hospitals as well as in context of
          families or religious events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 27/07/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the past few days can be observed in many federal states. However, more than 60% of
      the newly reported cases are due to increases in North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria and Baden-
      Wuerttemberg. The number of newly reported COVID-19 cases has decreased in the last two days. This
      decline, which can often be observed on Sunday and Monday, is most likely due to the delay in testing
      and reporting over the weekend.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller incidents in different administrative districts, which are connected
      in different ways, e.g. larger celebrations in the family settings, leisure activities, jobs, but also in
      community and health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among
      people returning from travels outside of Germany.
      The number of new cases reported daily had already increased in recent days. This development is very
      concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided at all costs. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be
      committed, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also in outdoor settings, airing
      indoor areas and, where necessary, wearing a community or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 205,609
      (+340) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been electronically
      reported to and validated by the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 88 districts reported no cases in the past 7
      days. In the past few weeks, the number of districts that have not submitted any COVID-19 cases over a
      period of 7 days has decreased continuously; 2 weeks ago (12th July) 125 districts reported no cases
      during the past 7 days. Information on laboratory-confirmed cases is also available on the RKI website
      at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and
      https://corona.rki.de.

  Germany by county and federal state (27/07/20220, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
  information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 63,226 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all reported cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 5,829 were children under 10 years of age (2.8%), 10,584 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.1%), 91,321 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 61,215 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (30%), 30,772 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,425 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.6%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 499 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48
  years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (27/07/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 174,974 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
  cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,215 cases (3.0%). Since
  calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
  ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
  reported in 4,651 of 31,130 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,379 (17%) of 179,134 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 190,400 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  In total, 9,118 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.4% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,040 (55%) are men and 4,073 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
  five cases. The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,797 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
  older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
  under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
  all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
  the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
  female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
  among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
  reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
  persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the Dingolfing-
  Landau district (Bavaria). The increase is due to an outbreak among harvest workers of an agricultural
  company. In the company with over 450 employees, 174 SARS-CoV-2-infections were identified. A
  quarantine was ordered for the entire operation. The local population (3300 inhabitants) is offered
  voluntary testing.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
  Hof (Bavaria). Several events are responsible for this increase. An outbreak in a large family affects

    several families in surrounding towns. Another outbreak is related to a family event, affecting also
    people of another federal state (Thuringia). Due to the ongoing screening, further cases can be
    expected.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for

    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 27/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 23/07/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.28 (95%-prediction interval: 1.02 – 1.54) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 27/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection

     interval: 0.96 – 1.23) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 27/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported 7-day R value has been at 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a larger
     number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased steadily in
     recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
       German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
