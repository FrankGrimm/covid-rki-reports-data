COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 25/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    Since calendar week 29 the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly overall and in many
             federal states. The number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has
             decreased markedly. Although case numbers have started to decrease in some states, this
             development remains very concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 10.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
             A total of only 15 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 126 districts the
             7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Hesse, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, the 7-day incidence is considerably higher, in Berlin
             and North Rhine Westphalia slightly higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 234,853 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,277 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, educational settings,
             various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among
             travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 25/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. It is noticeable that the average age of infection decreased over the past few weeks
      and that the incidence particularly in younger age groups has increased and is much higher than in older
      age groups.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many small outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger events with family and friends. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases
      are being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and increasing in dynamic. A further worsening of the situation must be avoided. On
      the one hand, the increase in younger age groups needs to be stopped, on the other hand, transmission
      into older and vulnerable groups needs to be prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises
      among elderly people, hospitalisations and number of deaths will likely rise as well. This can only be
      prevented if the entire population continues to be committed to decreasing transmission, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also outdoors -, by airing indoor areas
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community or face mask correctly. Large gatherings – especially
      indoors – should be avoided, and events with family and friends should be limited to close family
      members and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 234,853
      (+1,278) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 15 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past
      few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days
      decreased continuously; on 12/07/2020 the number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to
      125 districts.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 79,836 cases (34%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Figure 2: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or –if
  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (25/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 8,060 were children under 10 years of age (3.4%), 14,914 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.4%), 108,071 persons aged 20 to 49 years (46%), 65,690 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (28%), 31,900 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,549 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.4%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 669 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 46 years
  (median age 46 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 4 shows a high proportion of cases at the beginning of the pandemic
  in reporting weeks 11 to 14 in the age groups 20 - 59 years. With the decrease in the number of cases
  from reporting week 15 onwards, the proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply,
  but then decreased again continuously from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a
  significant decrease in the number of cases. This development continued in the following weeks. In
  comparison, the proportion of cases in the younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased
  in the same period, but with a concurrent decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the
  proportions across all age groups entered a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations, but as of week
  32 the proportion of cases among 10 to 30 year olds is increasing. The absolute number of cases has
  been increasing since week 29.

  weeks 10 to 34 (25/08/2020, 12:00 AM). The total number of weekly cases is depicted by the red line.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 195,563 (83%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (45%), fever (38%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,418 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 7,798 of 51,222 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 32,045 (16%) of 203,098 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status. Approximately 209,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection.
  Since the exact date of recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this
  number.

  * Data not yet meaningful, as outcome of the diseases in these weeks is still unclear
  Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalization and deaths by reporting week. The mean age of COVID-
  19 cases has been decreasing since reporting week 16. The proportion of hospitalized patients has been
  decreasing since week 17. The highest percentage of deaths was observed in week 16. Since then the
  percentage of COVID-19 deaths has been decreasing continuously. The weekly number of total cases has
  been increasing since week 29.
  A total of 9,277 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.0% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,138 (55%) are men and 4,135 (45%) are women (see Table 3), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,931 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 4).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 25/08/2020

  Possible countries of exposure
  Of the 234,853 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
  77.547 (33%) cases.
  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 45% (2,946 cases) for cases that had a possible
  foreign country as place of exposure and thereby the highest so far. It then fell steadily to 0.3% in
  reporting week 19 (21 cases) as a result of travel restrictions. Since the 25th reporting week, borders
  have reopened, initially in Europe. Since then, the proportion of cases reporting a probable country of
  infection abroad has markedly increased, to 42% (3,858 cases) in week 34 (Figure 4). In weeks 31-34,
  2020, 10,139 persons reported a possible site of infection abroad, naming a total of 10,387 countries
  (more than one country specified in some cases) .
  Figure 5: Presentation of the cases with probable place of infection abroad compared to all other cases (exposure in Germany
  and place of exposure unknown) and the proportion of cases with exposure abroad, in reporting week 10 to 34, 2020.
  Table 5 lists the top 15 countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks
  31 to 34. The Western Balkan countries, as well as Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain and Romania were most
  frequently reported as the country of exposure. In week 34 France was also frequently mentioned as the
  country of infection. When looking at the different age groups (not shown), it is noticeable that among
  the cases with reports of a place of infection in Kosovo and Turkey, children and middle-aged persons
  are over-represented, indicating possible family related visits. On the other hand, in the cases with a
  probable place of infection in Spain, Croatia and Bulgaria, persons between 20-29 years of age were
  over-represented, suggesting tourism for recreation and pleasure.
  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad has increased significantly in recent
  weeks. Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases
  can be greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and
  hygiene and avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be
  tested immediately. In addition, travellers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry
  must maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).

  Outbreaks
  In 16 districts an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants was reported, including
  the city of Offenbach in Hesse with an incidence of >50 cases/ 100.000 inhabitants in the past 7 days.
  The federal states mainly affected are Hesse, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. The increased
  incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but
  also to transmission in family and other private events.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.

     Figure 6: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
     cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
     electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 25/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 21/08/2020).
     A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
     estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
     This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
     outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
     affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
     relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
     The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.90 (95%-prediction interval: 0.74 – 1.10) and is based on
     electronically notified cases as of 25/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.92 (95% prediction
     interval: 0.83 – 1.03) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 25/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values has been around 1 since mid-July 2020. According to current observations, this
     seems to be associated to a great extent with an increasing number of cases among travel returnees, a
     larger number of smaller outbreaks and the overall case numbers in Germany, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of disease control measures.

   DIVI intensive care register
       The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
       collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
       16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
       As of 25/08/2020, a total of 1,280 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
       30,532 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,494 (70%) are occupied, and 9,038 (30%) are
       currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
       reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
       in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
       mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with a clear
       acceleration in recent weeks. At the same time, the number of districts that have not reported any cases
       in the last 7 days is decreasing. There are larger and smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in
       connection with celebrations in the circle of family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees,
       especially in the younger age groups, also contribute to the increase in the number of cases. Vaccines
       and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of
       the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
       the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
       measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
       play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
       indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
       is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
       maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
       risk of transmission outdoors.
       Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 25/08/2020
12
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
     individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
     previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
     Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
