      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

      Summary (as of 25/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the health
          of the general population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 6,729 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 217 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 111 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony,
          Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
      • Of 412 districts, 393 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 220 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population
          and of these, 12 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 87 and of people ≥80 years 235 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 25/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,619 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +450 existing patients had
          been discharged (38% of whom had died) and +441 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was -9 more than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,554,355 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 1.9%) and
          228,763 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 25/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
  19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to decrease slightly; depending on the region.
  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this means
  a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
  should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide, for which both their effect on the
  spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations are being examined in detail. Since mid
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. By now there is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. Currently there is no evidence that infections with variant B.1.1.7 lead to
  more serious diseases. At least for the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty by BioNTech/Pfizer, an effectiveness
  against B.1.1.7 could be shown in first studies.
  Also in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. The
  effectiveness of vaccines is currently being tested for this variant as well. Furthermore, a SARS-CoV-2
  variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of Amazonas.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection process is
  increasingly monitored by integrated molecular surveillance.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission
  to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case
  numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,141,665
  (+6,729) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,142,291 cases (53 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (25/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this means
  a high number of new infections per day.

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
      with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
      with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 25/01/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,929 intensive care
      beds were registered, of which 22,121 (82%) are occupied, and 4,808 (18%) are currently available. The
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
      as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
      senior care homes.
      Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
      is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
      reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-
      CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

 Annex
    1
      The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former
    cases may be included.
    2
      Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
    number of recovered cases.
    3
      The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and
    hospitalization but not for late effects because such data were not recorded regularly.
    4
      Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are
    reported.
