  The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
    COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
    Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
    situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 17/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged
        to commit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.
    • Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 179 cases per 100,000 population. In
        Saxony and Thuringia it is severely above the overall incidence.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of
        people ≥60 years is currently 173 cases/100,000 population.
    • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 1 district has an incidence of ≤25 cases/100,000 population.
        In comparison, 351 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 52 districts have an incidence of >250-
        500 cases/100,000 population and 10 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households
        and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious events. For a
        large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • With 4,856 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.
    • Yesterday, 26,923 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 698 new deaths
        associated with COVID-19.
    • RKI’s risk assessment was updated. RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population as very high.
    • Yesterday, about 3500 cases too few were transmitted from Baden-Wuerttemberg. Especially the 7-day incidence, but also other key
        figures are therefore reduced nationwide, but especially in Baden-Wuerttemberg compared to the actual value.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 17/12/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well
      as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the rise in cases could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since 04/12/2020 case numbers have been sharply increasing again.
      The R-value is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2
      infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in
      a high number of new infections every day.
      Due to pending data investigations, the R-value can only be used to a limited extent today.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly in
      households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and educational
      settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without
      traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, the 7-day incidence increases in all age groups, particularly in persons aged 80 or over. As the
      latter more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also
      increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection
      control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
      should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,406,161
  (+26,923) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  * From Baden-Wuerttemberg, appr. 3,500 cases were not transmitted yesterday due to technical difficulties. The problem is solved

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020,
  Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020
  onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is unknown for 771,519 cases (55%) thus their date of
  reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (17/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported
  COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities, the
  proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

  Due to changes in the variables, no notifications according to §42 are listed here.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36. The high number of cases
  among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous
  reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (411 of 412). There are 52 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 10 districts with an
  incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected
  districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
  course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.

    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
    affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
    • Due to pending data investigations, the R-value can only be used to a limited extent today.

    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 17/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 13/12/2020).
    The R-value is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2
    infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in
    a high number of new infections every day.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 17/12/020, a total of 1,290 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,102
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,452 (83%) are occupied, and 4,650 (17%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In week 50, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased, but
     remained on a relatively low level. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week
     36, 2020. Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 50, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) remained stable. The ARI rate has been stable since week 46, 2020 and remained on a level below that
     of previous seasons. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 88 of 236
     sentinel samples (37%) in week 50, 2020. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 61 samples (26%) and
     SARS-CoV-2 was found in 28 samples (12%), where 1 patient had a double infection of both viruses. No
     influenza virus was detected. Within the sentinel, the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is increasing. Further
     information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
     (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
     respiratory tract). In week 49, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable. The number of SARI
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    cases in the age groups 35 years and above remained on a high level, comparable to the level within
    previous influenza seasons. In contrast, the number of SARI cases in children aged 0 to 14 years has been
    below the usual level since week 40, 2020.
    Since week 46, 2020, more than half of the reported SARI cases per week have been diagnosed with COVID-
    19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). In week 49, 2020, the proportion of COVID-19 infections remained
    stable at 60%. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age groups can be found in Table 4. The
    proportions of COVID-19 cases in all age groups in autumn (weeks 40 to 48, 2020) have been more than
    twice as high as in spring (weeks 12 to 20, 2020). In week 49, 2020, the proportion of COVID-19 cases was
    exceptionally high in the age groups above 14 years, comprising more than half of the SARI cases in this
    week. This proportion was highest in SARI cases aged between 15 to 34 years at 78%. Within the 72 sentinel
    hospitals, there were 2 COVID-19 cases among SARI patients below 15 years of age in week 49, 2020. Please
    note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and
    hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

 Data on emergency department utilization
    In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/), and
    with the ESEG project partners
    (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/ESEG/ESEG_node.html), the RKI analyses
    emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
    https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
    Within the emergency department situation report of the 16 December 2020, data from 21 emergency
    departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 13 December 2020. In week 50-
    2020, 11,359 admissions were recorded; which was a -1.7% change compared to last week, and a -28.5%
    average change compared to the mean of last year (see Figure 5).

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
       situation on 11/12/2020. The RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general population to be very
       high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as the
       occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and senior care homes.
       Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
       is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
       substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
