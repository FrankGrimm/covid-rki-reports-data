  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.

    Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
       To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
       clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
       ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey,
       via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance
       established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a
       professional association of laboratory medicine.
       The number of tests, the proportion of positive tests and number of reporting laboratories since the
       beginning of testing in Germany are shown in table 2. Since laboratories can register and correct the tests of
       the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can increase
       retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of persons
       tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients (Table 2) with data for the last 10 weeks
       – complete data since beginning of testing are available at http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in
       German). The current testing criteria can be found under: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In week 9, 2021, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) increased overall,
     mainly due to an increase in the ARI rate for ages under 15 years. Despite the increase, the overall ARI rate
     is still below the level of the previous years. Further information can be found under
     https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 9, 2021, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) slightly increased. The ARI rate has increased for age groups under 35 years in week 9, 2021, but has
     remained stable or decreased in age groups 35 years and above. Since week 2, 2021, the ARI rate has been
     on a markedly lower level compared to previous years. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory
     viruses were detected in 55 of 196 sentinel samples (28%) in week 9, 2021. Among those, rhinovirus was
     identified in 37 samples (19%), human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) in 10 samples (5%), SARS-CoV-2 in
     6 samples (3%), Respiratory Syncitial Virus in two samples and Parainfluenzavirus was found in one sample
     (1%). Since week 40, 2020, SARS-COV-2 has been found in 215 (8%) of 2,765 samples. Influenza virus has
     been detected none of the 2,772 samples tested since week 40, 2020. Further information can be found
     under https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
     (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
     respiratory tract). In week 8, 2021, the overall number of SARI cases remained stable. The number of SARI
     cases has been markedly lower than usual at this time of the year for several weeks.
     After a steady decrease, the proportion of COVID-19 infections increased again to 56% in week 8. In the
     previous week, less than half of the reported SARI cases per week had been diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-
     10 code U07.1!) for the first time since week 44, 2020, (Figure 4). Due to low case numbers, proportions of

    Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
       population to be very high. The revised version highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-
       CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in nursing and senior care homes, households, and
       occupational settings.
       Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
       rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
       outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
       vulnerable persons.
       On 26/02/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
       current version can be found here: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

  Annex
     1
       The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
       transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
     2
       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
       number of recovered cases.
     3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
       hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
     4
       Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
       reported.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
