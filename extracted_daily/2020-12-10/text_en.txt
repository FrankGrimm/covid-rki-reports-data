1 The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former cases may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 10/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
        encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers are notably increasing again.
    • The national 7-day incidence is 149 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony it is considerably above, in Bavaria, Berlin and
        Thuringia moderately above the national average.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 138 cases/100,000 population.
    • Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 10 districts transmitted an incidence of ≤25
        cases/100,000 population. In comparison, 303 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
        37 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
        households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to
        religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • With 4,339 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.
    • On 09/12/2020, 23,679 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the highest number since the beginning of the
        pandemic, have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 440 new deaths associated with COVID-19.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 10/12/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September, a
      steep increase in case numbers ensued in October in all federal states. Due to measures implemented at
      the beginning of November the increase could be stopped, albeit no considerable reduction in case
      numbers ensued. Since 04/12/2020 case numbers are notably increasing again.
      Since November, the reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1. An R-value around 1 means that,
      on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected
      persons is currently very high in Germany, this results in a high number of new infections every day.
      Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany in various settings, particularly
      in households and increasingly in nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational and
      educational settings. Additionally, in many districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2
      without traceable transmission chains.
      While the 7-day-incidence among younger age groups is stable or slightly decreasing, the incidence
      among older people is further increasing. As the latter more often have more severe illness due to
      COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These can be avoided if all prevent
      the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 1,242,203
  (+23,679) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI (Table
  1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 673,369 cases (54%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (10/12/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (402 of 412). There are 37 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 and 2 districts with an
  incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts, the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many outbreaks
  particularly in households and retirement and nursing homes, but also in various occupational settings,
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities such as kindergartens and
  schools, and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to the elevated incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                               7-day R-value
                                 0.90                                                                      1.03
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.77 – 1.05)                                      (95%- prediction interval: 0.95 – 1.13)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    Figure 3: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
    COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 10/12/2020, 12 AM, considering cases up to 06/12/2020).
    The reported R-values have been fluctuating around 1 in November. An R-value around 1 means that, on
    average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected
    persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still a high number of new infections
    every day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 10/12/2020, a total of 1,290 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,295
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,542 (83%) are occupied, and 4,753 (17%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 49, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
     stable. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further
     information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 49, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) remained stable on a level below that of previous seasons. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI,
     respiratory viruses were detected in 50 of 164 sentinel samples (30%) in week 49, 2020. Among those,
     rhinovirus was identified in 32 samples (20%) and SARS-CoV-2 was found in 19 samples (12%), where 1
     patient had a double infection of both viruses. No influenza virus was detected. Within the sentinel, the
     circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is slowly increasing, whereas the rate of rhinovirus positive samples has been
     decreasing over the past few weeks. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 48, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased slightly. The
     number of SARI cases in the age groups 35 years and above remained on a high level, comparable to the
     level within previous influenza seasons. In contrast, the number of SARI cases in children aged 0 to 14

    years has been below the usual level since week 40, 2020. Of all reported SARI cases in week 48, 2020,
    57% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). The proportion of COVID-19
    infections among SARI by age groups can be found in Table 4. The proportions of COVID-19 cases in all
    age groups were markedly higher in autumn (weeks 40 to 47, 2020) than in spring (weeks 12 to 20,
    2020). In week 48, 2020, the proportion of COVID-19 cases was exceptionally high in the age groups
    above 14 years, comprising more than half of the SARI cases in this week. This proportion was highest in
    SARI cases aged between 35 to 59 years at 71%. Within the 72 sentinel hospitals, there have been no
    COVID-19 cases among SARI cases below 15 years of age in week 48, 2020. Please note that due to data
    availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration
    of up to one week were included in this analysis.

 Data on emergency department utilization
     In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
     and with the ESEG project partners
     (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/ESEG/ESEG_node.html), the RKI analyses
     emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
     https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
     Within the emergency department situation report of the 09 December 2020, data from 19 emergency
     departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 06 December 2020. In week
     49-2020, 10,071 admissions were recorded; which was a +1.9% change compared to last week, and a -
     25.8% average change compared to the mean of last year (see Figure 5).
     Figure 5: Relative deviation of admissions in each emergency department compared to its mean in 2019, from January 2019 to
     December 2020 (as of 09 December 2020), averaged over all emergency departments.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the current
     situation on 01/12/2020. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
     as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
     senior care homes. Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection
     of vulnerable groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new
     infections can be substantially reduced. The current version can be found here:
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikobewertung.html (in German)
