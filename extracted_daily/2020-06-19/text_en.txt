    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among notified cases, 4,329 were children
    under 10 years of age (2.3%), 8,820 children and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (4.7%), 82,125 persons
    aged 20 to 49 years (43%), 58,021 persons aged 50 to 69 years (31%), 29,825 persons aged 70 to 89
    years (16%) and 5,315 persons aged 90 years and older (2.8%). The age is unknown in 99 notified cases.
    The mean age of cases is 49 years (median age 49 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons
    aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (19/06/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 161,716 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 4,907 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 2,816 of 19,189 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 28,691 (18%) of 163,249 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 174,400 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Law, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 26% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    So far, 13,628 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

   COVID-19 Situation Report 19/06/2020

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence was observed in three districts, primarily due to localised outbreaks: The districts
    of, Guetersloh (North-Rhine-Westphalia), Verden (Lower Saxony) and Magdeburg (Saxony-Anhalt),
    Neukölln (Berlin) and Warendorf (North Rhine-Westphalia).
    A local COVID-19 outbreak among harvest workers in the district of Aichach-Friedberg had led to a sharp
    increase in the 7-day incidence.The applied measures (isolation, hygiene as well as identification and
    testing of contact persons), which were initiated immediately, as well as the early termination of the
    seasional harvest work, have led to a containment of the outbreak. The 7-day incidence has fallen
    considerably.
    The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
    plant. Several hundred employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Contact tracing is ensured at the
    present time. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are being
    quarantined. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the district will be closed from 18.06. until
    the end of the summer holidays (11.08.2020).
    The outbreak in Guetersloh is linked to an outbreak in Warendorf LK. Employees of the meat processing
    company are residents of neighbouring districts.
    In Magdeburg, an outbreak affecting several now closed schools has led to an increase in the 7-day
    incidence.
    In Neukölln, a district of Berlin, an outbreak is linked to members of a religious community. So far 85
    cases are linked to this outbreak.
    Once again there were major outbreaks in retirement- and nursing homes. In the district of Verden
    residents and nursing staff have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Further outbreaks were reported among members of religious communities, eg. from Berlin, Hesse and
    and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.

      Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 19/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 15/06/2020).
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day-R-value is 1.06 (95%-prediction interval: 0.87 – 1.30)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 19/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.17 (95%-prediction
      interval: 1.02– 1.34) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 19/06/2020, 12:00 AM. In light of
      the still low daily case numbers, both R-values should be interpreted with caution and in their course
      over several days.
      Estimates of the reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value) are slightly above 1, indicating that
      at the moment the number of new cases is not further declining. This is mainly related to local
      outbreaks which are described above. Since case numbers in Germany are generally low, these
      outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction number. A general
      increase of case numbers in Germany is not expected.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 19/06/2020, a total of 1,270 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,759
      intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,239 (66%) are occupied, and 10,520 beds (34%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
      differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
      discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
  Mortality monitoring
      A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
      excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
      the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
      (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data,
      have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
      monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
      All-cause mortality for the countries in the EuroMOMO network are approaching normal levels,
      following a period of a substantial excess mortality coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. A few
      countries are still seeing some excess mortality. Excess mortality was observed primarily in the age
      group of over-65s, but also in the age group of 15-64s.
      Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with
      a certain time lag (currently 24/05/2020)
      https://www.destatis.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2020/06/PD20_203_12621.html?nn=209016. A
      special evaluation on excess mortality is updated every two weeks:
      https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
      Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German). Looking at the
      development by months, in March 2020 there is no noticeable increase in the number of deaths
      compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, the mortality figures were significantly
      above the average of previous years; since the beginning of May, the mortality figures have been back
      to around the average.

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
