       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. An overview of the
       weekly schedule of topics is available at: www.rki.de/covid-19-en

       Summary (as of 04/03/2021, 12:00 AM)
        From March 6, 2021, the English situation report will no longer be published daily, but replaced by a weekly report on Thursdays.
        Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the
           health of the general population to be very high.
        Yesterday, 11,912 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 359 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
           transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 65 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence in Bremen, Saxony and
           Saxony-Anhalt is slightly, in Thuringia considerably above the national incidence.
        In 258 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 60 districts, the 7-day
           incidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in two of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
        The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 45 and among the age group ≥80 years 57 cases/100,000 pop.
        The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
           households, occupational settings as well as nursing and long-term care homes.
        On 04/03/2021 (12:15 PM) 2.813 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. +344 COVID-19 patients were newly admitted. The
           resulting number of cases under treatment was -10 compared to the prior day. 95 COVID-19 patients died on ICU since the prior
           day.
        Since 26/12/2020 a total of 4,541,389 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 5.5 %) and of
           those 2,271,784 people twice (vaccination rate 2.7 %) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
        In this situation report, the following additional information is given: information from additional RKI based surveillance systems
           for acute respiratory illness, and data on emergency department utilization.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 04/03/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², the RKI classifies all cases of laboratory
  confirmation via SARS-CoV-2-nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) detection or SARS-CoV-2 isolation as COVID-19
  cases, regardless of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, in the following report the term
  "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
  From March 6, 2021, the English situation report will no longer be published daily, but replaced by a weekly
  report on Thursdays. For information on daily COVID-19 epidemiology in Germany, the Dashboard is
  updated on a daily basis (https://corona.rki.de/). In addition, tables with information on notification data
  are regularly uploaded on our website and the daily situation reports in German language can be accessed
  under https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Gesamt.html.
  General current assessment
  At the moment, there is an increase in the number of cases.
  The 7-day R-value is currently around 1. Due to the occurrence of different virus variants (see below) there
  is an increased risk of a renewed stronger increase in the number of cases.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number
  of serious cases and deaths remains at a high level. These can only be avoided if all persons prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by correctly wearing a surgical mask or FFP2 mask (or N95 or KN95 respectively).
  Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide. Since mid-December 2020 there
  have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United Kingdom. There is
  increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased infectiousness of this variant.
  Additionally, there are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with variant B.1.1.7 may
  lead to more severe diseases. Moreover, in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2
  variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased
  infectiousness is conceivable. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that the efficacy of the licensed mRNA
  vaccines is apparently not substantially affected by the variants B.1.1.7. and B.1.351. Additionally, a SARS-
  CoV-2 variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Non-essential
  travel should be avoided – especially due to the circulation of variants of concern.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH - www.rki.de/covid-19-desh) the infection process is
  increasingly monitored through integrated molecular surveillance.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,220,266 cases (49%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After further case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, while values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently
  estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                                0.89                                                            0.99
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.78 – 1.05)                            (95%-prediction interval: 0.93 – 1.08)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  The 7-day R-value is currently around 1. However, due to the occurrence of different virus variants there is
  an increased risk of a renewed increase in the number of cases.

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
      with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
      with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 04/03/2021, a total of 1,280 hospitals reported to the Intensivregister. Overall, 24,153 intensive care
      beds for adults were reported, of which 20,417 (85%) are occupied, and 3,736 (15%) ICU-beds for adults are
      currently available. The number of current COVID-19 ICU-treatments is shown in Table 2.
      Table 2: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (04/03/2021, 12:15 PM).

      The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
      *Due to patient transfers from one ICU for further treatment to another ICU, more than one treatment can be reported per patient
      (multiple counting possible).
  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for acute respiratory illnesses
      GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
      utilizing information from the population. In week 8, 2021, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained stable
      overall and for ages 15 years and above, although the ARI rate increased children under 15 years. The
      overall ARI rate is still below the level of the previous years. Further information can be found under
      https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
      The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
      practices. In week 8, 2021, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
      rate) decreased. Since week 2, 2021, the ARI rate has been on a markedly lower level compared to previous
      years. The ARI rate has increased in children under 15 years of age in week 8, 2021, but has decreased in
      age groups 15 years and above. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in
      33 of 159 sentinel samples (21%) in week 8, 2021. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 16 samples
      (10%), SARS-CoV-2 in 12 samples (8%) and human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) was found in 5 samples
      (3%). Since week 40, 2020, SARS-COV-2 has been found in 209 (8%) of 2,566 samples. Sporadic human
      seasonal coronaviruses (hCoV) are identified since week 2, 2020. Influenza virus or Respiratory Syncitial
      Virus have been detected none of the 2,573 samples tested since week 40, 2020. Further information can
      be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.

    A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
    (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
    respiratory tract). In week 7, 2021, the overall number of SARI cases remained stable. The number of SARI
    cases has been markedly lower than usual at this time of the year for several weeks.
    For the first time since week 44, 2020, less than half of the reported SARI cases per week have been
    diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). The proportion of COVID-19 infections has been
    decreasing since week 3, 2021 to 49% in week 7, 2021. Due to low case numbers, proportions of COVID-19
    cases in different age groups were not calculated. Please note that due to data availability only patients
    with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were
    included in this analysis.

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. The revised version highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-
      CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in nursing and senior care homes, households, and
      occupational settings.
      Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
      rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
      outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
      vulnerable persons.
      On 26/02/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
      current version can be found here: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

   Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
        transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
        number of recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
        hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
      4
        Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
        reported.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
