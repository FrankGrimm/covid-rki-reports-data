2   COVID-19 Situation Report 14/03/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    Case numbers1
      With over 3,000 cases in Germany, the COVID-19 case numbers can no longer be manually updated and reported
      in a quality assured manner. Therefore, epidemiological evaluations in the COVID-19 situation report are based
      only on the electronically transmitted data available to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at the time of the data
      closure. The number of cases notified in advance manually will be listed in addition to the electronically reported
      cases until 16/03/2020 (see Table 1), after which only the electronically transmitted cases will be shown.
      A total of 3,795 (+733) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been detected
      in Germany since 27/01/2020, of which 3,421 were electronically reported to and validated at the RKI. So far, 8
      deaths related to COVID-19 diseases were reported.
      Information on laboratory-confirmed cases
      So far, 3,421 cases in 16 federal states have been laboratory-confirmed (Table 1).

    Information on electronically reported cases
    Of the 3.795 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far 3,421 cases from 16 states have been electronically reported to
    the Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 3,421 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (14/03/2020)
    Among these cases, 1,936 are male (57%) and 1,476 female (43%). The age range is from 0 to 95 years, including
    31 children under the age of 5, 88 children aged 5-14 and 2,706 persons in the age groups 15 to 59 years and 525
    persons 60 years and older (see Figure 2). The age of 10 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 46 years.
    Figure 2: Electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by age group and sex (n=3,394 with data available, 14/03/2020)
    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 13/03/2020. In 1.360 cases, onset of
    symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

      alternatively by date of reporting; in 4 cases neither date was available (14/03/2020)
      Further information
      The 8 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 5 men and 3 women, all older
      than 65 years of age, from 3 states (Northrhine-Westfalia (5) Baden-Wurttemberg (3) and Bavaria (1).
      In addition, 2 German tourists died of COVID-19 in Egypt on 08/03/20202 and 11/03/2020.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as moderate. However, this risk varies from region to
      region and is high in "particularly affected areas". The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The burden on the health care system depends on the regional
      distribution of cases, health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social
      distancing etc.), and may be very high in some regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of
      new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     As of 12/03/2020, the following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:
                 o     District of Heinsberg (North Rhine Westphalia)
      -     All federal states are implementing measures to enforce social distancing, such as cancellation of mass
            gatherings, closure of cultural institutions such as museums, theaters, concert halls, limiting operation of
            restaurants, bars and clubs, as well as school and daycare closures starting the week of 22/03/2020.
      -     As of 12/03/2020, the following regions are classified as risk areas (www.rki.de/covid-19-risikogebiete):
