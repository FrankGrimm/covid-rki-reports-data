 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 01/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
      COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must still
      be carefully monitored.
  • The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 14.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
      The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 4 districts: the cities of Hamm and
      Remscheid, the district of Berlin Mitte and Rhön-Grabfeld. In a further 38 districts, it exceeded 25
      cases/100,000 inhabitants. A total of 8 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg, and North Rhine-Westphalia was considerably
      higher, in Bavaria and Hesse slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • In total, 291,722 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,500 deaths associated with COVID-19
      have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
      clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
      and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
      settings, and among travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 01/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The 4-day R-value has been predominantly greater
      than 1 since the second week of September.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent some time after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can only be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
      where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
      be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 291,722
  (+2,503) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1). A total of 8 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a
  total of 139 districts reported zero cases.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 108,890 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (01/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Due to changes in data registration, not all data entries for cases ascertained in the most recent version of the surveillance software could be
  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 42 districts,
  including the cities of Hamm, Remscheid, Berlin Mitte and the district Rhön-Grabfeld with 7-day
  incidences of > 50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to about 200 cases in connection with a
  wedding. More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine
  (https://www.hamm.de/corona). Stricter distancing measures have been implemented in Hamm
  (https://www.hamm.de/aktuelles/weitere-corona-massnahmen-beschlossen).
  In the city of Remscheid the high incidence is primarily due to smaller outbreaks in day care centres and
  schools with spread to outside contacts. Stricter control measures have been implemented
  (https://remscheid.de/corona#chapter146380100000143530-1015_sp_main_iterate_1_0).
  The outbreak in Berlin Mitte is attributable to a number of causes, such as the spread among young and
  international travellers and party guests, who contract the infection during travel or at parties and
  subsequently infect household members and family.

  In the district Rhön-Grabfeld cases can be partially attributed to an outbreak in a nursing/retirement
  home. Quarantine and isolation measures have been implemented.
  Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to transmission at family and other private events. The
  proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-19-related
  outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community
  facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
  extracted from the notification system.
                         4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                               0.90                                                             1.05
        (95%-prediction interval: 0.74 – 1.06)                               (95%-prediction interval: 0.95– 1.14)
  Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
  electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 01/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 27/09/2020).
  The reported R values have been predominantly greater than 1 since the second week in September.
  Although the 4-day R-value is below 1 today, this development must continue to be monitored closely.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
  23/04/2020).

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 01/10/2020, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,538
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,832 (71%) are occupied, and 8,706 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.
     Table 3: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (01/10/2020, 12:15 PM).

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account that the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number
     of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or
     increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
      systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 39, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
     stable. Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 39, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
     decreased slightly in all age groups. Overall, it remained at a similar level to that of previous seasons at
     this time of the year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, virus was detected in 25 of 39 sentinel
     samples (64%) in week 39, 2020, including 24 samples with rhinovirus and one sample with SARS-COV-2
     virus. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 38, 2020, the total number of SARI cases remained stable compared
     to week 37. Of all reported SARI cases in week 37, 2020, 5% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code
     U07.1!) (see Figure 3). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for
     SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Data on emergency department utilisation
     Data on emergency department utilisation
     In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
     the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
     https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html.
     As of 27 September 2020, data from 9 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between
     1 November 2019 and 1 March 2020, an average of 6,356 emergency department admissions per week
     was recorded. From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions
     was observed, to 3,697 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable
     surveillance systems in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions,
     public measures were taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase in
     admissions has been observed. In week 39 2020, 5,679 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the
     number of admissions is currently 10% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see
     Figure 4).
