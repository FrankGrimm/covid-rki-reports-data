COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 05/09/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    Since calendar week 35 the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has slightly decreased after a rise between
             calendar week 29 and 34. Although the number of new cases has started to decrease, the situation
             must still be carefully monitored.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 8.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
             total of 21 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 148 districts the 7-day-
             incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Baden-Wuerttemberg, Berlin, Bavaria, Bremen and Hamburg the 7-day incidence is considerably
             higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 248,997 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,324 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, educational settings,
             various occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among
             travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 05/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of the WHO 1, the RKI evaluates all laboratory diagnostic
    evidence of SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 cases, regardless of the presence or severity of the clinical symptoms.
    In the following report, "COVID-19 cases" thus includes both acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19
    diseases.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July has stabilized in the last week and the 7-day
    incidence has fallen again nationwide. The R-value is currently 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks
    more young people have become infected, thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger age
    groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
    situations, e.g. larger celebrations in the family and among friends. In addition, COVID-19 cases are
    identified to a large extent among travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups.
    The current development is positive, but must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the
    proportion of deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of
    younger people among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A
    renewed increase in new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a
    renewed increase among the elderly and particularly among vulnerable groups of the population, as was
    the case at the beginning of the pandemic. If more elderly people become infected again, a renewed
    increase in hospitalizations and deaths must be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.
    Geographical distribution of cases
    Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
    Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 248,997
    (+1,378) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
    RKI (see Table 1). A total of 21 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 the
    number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 87,522 cases (35%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  Clinical aspects
  Approximately 222,900 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,324 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (3.7% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,169 (55%) are men and 4,151 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years).

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases; the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

5                                                                                                                                   5
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
    according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 3).
    The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
    Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
    Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
    care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
    The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
    outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Outbreaks
    In 7 districts an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants was reported. Affected
    are mainly districts in the federal state of Bavaria. The increased incidence in the affected districts is
    mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but also to transmission in family and
    other private events.
    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
    asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
    religious events.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI varies greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 05/09/2020

      A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
      estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
      This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
      outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
      affected persons, leading to the rapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
      relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.0 (95%-prediction interval: 0.77 – 1.28) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 05/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.97 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.86 – 1.11) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 05/09/2020, 12:00 AM.
      The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are around 1 or
      below 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers,
      particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number
      of smaller outbreaks. The current R-values reflect the stabilization of the country wide case numbers
      during the past days.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7-
      day R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values
      can also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020)
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
      dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
      worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
      beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week.
      Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with
      celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age
      groups, have also contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no
      approved vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
      The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
      very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
      play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In

    indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
    is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
    maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
    risk of transmission outdoors.
    Disease severity
    In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
    increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
    individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
    previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
    Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
    Burden on health system
    The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
    main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
    (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
    rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
