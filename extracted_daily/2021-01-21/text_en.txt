      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
      – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
      Summary (as of 21/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the
          health of the general population as very high.
      • Yesterday, 20,398 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,013 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 119 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,
          Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
      • Of 412 districts, 392 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 243 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000
          population and of these, 22 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 93 and of people ≥80 years 259 cases/100,000 population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 21/01/2021, 4,787 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care (-49 cases fewer than the day before). In the preceding 24
          hours, +769 existing patients had been discharged (28% of whom had died) and +720 patients were newly admitted. The
          resulting number of cases under treatment was -49 more than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,324,091 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.6%) and 77,602
          people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
      • In this situation report, the following additional information is given: information from additional RKI based surveillance
          systems for acute respiratory illness, data on emergency department utilization

  COVID-19 Situation Report 21/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of
  COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers seem to decrease slightly; depending on the
  region.
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in
  nursing and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many
  districts, there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
  indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
  especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide, for which both their effect on
  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations are being examined in detail. Since mid
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. By now there is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. Currently there is no evidence that infections with variant B.1.1.7 lead to
  more serious diseases. At least for the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty by BioNTech/Pfizer, an effectiveness
  against B.1.1.7 could be shown in first studies.
  Also in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa was reported,
  which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. The
  effectiveness of vaccines is currently being tested for this variant as well.
  Both variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection
  process is increasingly monitored by integrated molecular surveillance.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data
  transmission to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported
  incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,088,400
  (+20,398) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *In Brandenburg. some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by
  the RKI.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown for 1,123,364 cases (54 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in
  Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (21/01/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                  7-day R-value
                                0.84                                                            0.93
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.73 – 0.94)                          (95%-prediction interval: 0.87 – 0.99)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means a high number of new infections per day.

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 21/01/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,071 intensive care
      beds were registered, of which 22,836 (84%) are occupied, and 4,235 (16%) are currently available. The
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
  systems for acute respiratory illnesses
      GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
      (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 2, 2021, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
      stable. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further
      information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
      The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
      practices. In week 2, 2021, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
      rate) decreased. The ARI rate was on a markedly lower level compared to previous years. Within the viral
      surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 29 of 138 sentinel samples (21%) in week 2,
      2021. Among those, SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 15 samples (11%), rhinovirus in 11 samples (8%),
      human seasonal coronavirus in two samples (1%) and parainfluenzavirus was found in one sample (1%).
      Since week 40, 2020, SARS-COV-2 has been found in 137 (9%) of 1,601 samples. Influenza virus or
      Respiratory Syncitial Virus have been detected none of the 1,608 samples tested since week 40, 2020. In
      previous seasons (since 1997/98), influenza virus has been detected in at least one sample by week 2.
      Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
      A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
      patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
      the lower respiratory tract). In week 1, 2021, the total number of SARI cases remained stable. The
      number of SARI cases aged 80 years and above remained on a very high level, comparable to the level at

  the peak of previous influenza seasons. The number of SARI cases in children aged 0 to 14 years has
  been below the usual level since week 40, 2020.
  Since week 45, 2020, more than half of the reported SARI cases per week have been diagnosed with
  COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). In week 1, 2021, the proportion of COVID-19 infections
  decreased slightly to 65%. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age groups can be
  found in Table 4. The proportions of COVID-19 cases in all age groups in the weeks 40 to 53, 2020 have
  been more than twice as high as in spring (weeks 12 to 20, 2020). In week 1, 2021, the proportion of
  COVID-19 cases was exceptionally high in the age groups above 14 years, comprising more than 60% of
  the SARI cases in this week. This proportion was highest in SARI cases aged between 15 to 34 years and
  35 to 59 years at 75% and 73%, respectively. Within the 72 sentinel hospitals, there was one COVID-19
  case among SARI patients below 15 years of age in week 1, 2021. Please note that due to data
  availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration
  of up to one week were included in this analysis.

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the
     general population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2
     transmission as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and
     nursing and senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable
     groups is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections
     can be reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the
     new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:

        The difference to the previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay in data transmission former
      cases may be included.

        Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
      number of recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and
      hospitalization but not for late effects because such data were not recorded regularly.
