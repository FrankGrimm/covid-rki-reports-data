COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. Since 14.09.2020 the
RKI situation report will be published in a shortened version. The report will be more focused on the current situation. Demographic and clinical
aspects, for which there are only few daily changes, will be presented once a week and in a weekly comparison. Further data is also available in
the COVID 19 dashboard: https://corona.rki.de

        Summary (as of 14/09/2020 12:00 AM)
            After a high increase between calendar week 29 and 34, the 7-day-COVID-19 incidence has
             stabilized since calendar week 35. Even if the number of new cases does not increase significantly
             at the moment, the situation must still be carefully monitored.
            The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 10.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
             The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 3 districts: the district of Garmisch-
             Partenkirchen, and the cities Kaufbeuren and Würzburg in Bavaria. A total of 15 districts
             transmitted zero cases over the past 7 days. In a further 133 districts the 7-day incidence is below
             5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
            In Bavaria, Berlin, Hamburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg the 7-day incidence is considerably higher,
             in Hesse it is slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
            In total, 260,335 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,350 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
            Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing
             homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various
             occupational settings, in the context of religious or family events and especially among travellers.

        COVID-19 Situation Report 14/09/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory confirmed
    cases of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of clinical symptoms and disease severity. Thus, in the following report
    the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
    General current assessment
    The increase in the number of cases reported since mid-July has now stabilized at a slightly higher level. The
    R-value is currently around 1. It is noticeable that in the last few weeks more young people have become
    infected, thus the 7-day incidence is significantly higher in younger age groups than in older age groups.
    There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
    situations, e.g. larger celebrations in the family and among friends. In addition, COVID-19 cases are
    identified to a large extent among travel returnees, especially in the younger age groups.
    The current development must be further carefully monitored. The current decline in the proportion of
    deaths among the reported cases is mainly explained by the relatively high proportion of younger people
    among the newly diagnosed cases, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. A renewed increase in
    new infections must nevertheless be avoided. In particular, it is important to prevent a renewed increase
    among the elderly and vulnerable groups of the population, as was the case at the beginning of the
    pandemic. If more elderly and vulnerable people become infected again, a renewed increase in
    hospitalizations and deaths must be expected.
    It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
    consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
    where necessary, by wearing a mouth-nose cover correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
    be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 260,335
  (+927) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by the
  RKI (Table 1). A total of 15 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 the
  number of districts reporting zero cases still amounted to 139 districts.

     each federal state electronically reported to RKI, Germany (14/09/2020, 12:00 AM). The number of new cases covers positive
     cases, which have been sent to the local health department at the same day, but also at previous days.

     Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
     transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
     * No data transmission from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania yesterday.
     Distribution of cases over time
     The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure shows COVID-19 cases
     transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
     onset of symptoms is unknown for 93,645 cases (36%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (14/09/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to §36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to §23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  In 17 districts an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported, including
  the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the urban districts of Kaufbeuren and Würzburg, where the
  incidence is > 50 cases/100,000 population. Most districts affected are in the federal state of Bavaria.
  The increased incidence in the affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations
  abroad as well as transmission during family and other private events.
  Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for
  asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with
  religious events.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte
  nicht gefunden werden.) and not directly extracted from the notification system.
                         4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value

        (95%-prediction interval: 0.95 - 1.40)                               (95%-prediction interval: 0.92 – 1.16)

      The reported R values have been above 1 since mid-July 2020. Since mid-August they are below or
      around 1. The increased R-values can be attributed in large part to increasing cases among travellers,
      particularly returning after trips during the summer vacations, but also to a still existing larger number
      of smaller outbreaks.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
      23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
      collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
      16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
      As of 14/09/2020, a total of 1,282 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
      30,629 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,106 (69%) are occupied, and 9,523 (31%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.
      Table 3: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (14/09/2020, 14:15 PM).

      *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
      reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
      in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is dynamic and must be taken seriously. This is a
      dynamic and serious situation worldwide and in Germany. The number of cases continues to increase
      worldwide. The number of newly reported cases in Germany declined from about mid-March to the
      beginning of July, since then the number of cases has increased but has stabilized over the past week.
      Large and small outbreaks continue to occur throughout Germany, particularly in connection with
      celebrations with family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees, especially in the younger age
      groups, have also contributed to the increase in case numbers in July and August. There are still no
      approved vaccines and the treatment of severe disease courses is complex and lengthy.
      The Robert Koch Institute still estimates the risk to the health of the German population to be high, and
      very high for risk groups. This assessment may change in the short term due to new findings.

    Infection risk
    SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
    the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
    measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
    play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
    indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
    is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
    maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
    risk of transmission outdoors.
    Disease severity
    In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
    increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
    individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
    previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
    Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
    Burden on health system
    The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, the
    main population groups affected, the health care capacity and initiation of containment measures
    (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can
    rapidly increase locally and affect the public health system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
