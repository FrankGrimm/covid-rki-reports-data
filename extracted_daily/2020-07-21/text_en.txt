  Germany by county and federal state (21/07/20220, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
  information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 61,619 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

  The depiction of notified COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  groups and reporting week (see Figure 4), shows a continuous and distinct decrease in the relative
  propoartion among the over 80 year olds from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by
  a decrease in absolute case numbers which continued in the ensuing weeks. In comparions, the
  proportion of cases in the younger age groups up to 29 years of age increased over the same period,
  only to move into a plateau phase with only small fluctuations.
  The absolute number of cases increased in children and adolescents under 20 years of age up to week
  15 and then decreased continuously until week 21. After a plateau phase until week 24, the number of
  cases increased significantly in almost all age groups in week 25, only to decrease again in the following
  weeks. The increase in week 25 is related to the larger outbreak in a meat processing plant. Since week
  26, there has again been a plateau phase across all age groups, with a slight increase in week 29.

  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 172,510 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
  cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,171 cases (3.0%). Since
  calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
  ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
  reported in 4,273 of 28,850 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,105 (17%) of 176,443 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 188,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  In total, 9,090 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.5% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,024 (55%) are men and 4,061 (45%) are women (see Table 3), the gender was unknown in
  five cases. The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,778 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
  older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
  under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
  all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
  the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

     IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 4). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
  female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
  among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
  reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
  persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Countries of Exposure
  Borders have begun to open since reporting week 25, initially in Europe. Since then, among the
  countries reported as the probable place of exposure, the proportion of countries other than Germany
  has increased. This proportion peaked at 46% (2,970 cases) in reporting week 11, after which it rapidly
  decreased in association with the implemented travel restrictions to 0.4% (19 cases) in week 20. As of
  week 21 there is a slight increase, which is now at 10% (285 cases) in week 29.
  Table 5 lists the countries most frequently reported as the probable place of infection in weeks 25 to 29
  (countries mentioned in at least 10 cases) from total 7,803 numbers mentioned

  Outbreaks
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in two districts:
  the district of Vechta (Lower Saxony) and the district of Bitburg-Prüm (Rhineland-Palatinate).
  The increased COVID-19 incidence in the district of Bitburg-Pruem is related to cases initially detected in
  a rehabilitation clinic in the neighbouring district, with subsequent secondary transmission. Contact
  tracing has been intensified.
  An outbreak of COVID-19 cases was detected in the district of Vechta as a result of serial testing on
  >1000 employees of a meat processing company. Neighbouring districts are also affected.
  Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    Figure 5: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 21/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 17/07/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the case in
    Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.04 (95%-prediction interval: 0.83 – 1.27) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 21/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.08 (95% prediction
    interval: 0.97 – 1.20) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 21/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
    R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
    also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

      COVID-19 Situation Report 21/07/2020

   DIVI intensive care register
       A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
       RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
       number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
       hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       As of 21/07/2020, a total of 1,272 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
       32,637 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,237 (65%) are occupied, and 11,400 beds (35%)
       are currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in
       Table 6.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
       differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
       discharged
   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid-March. Currently, many districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
       German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
