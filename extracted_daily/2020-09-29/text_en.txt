 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
 Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
 situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 29/09/2020, 12:00 AM)
   After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported
      COVID-19 cases is currently evident in the population of Germany. Therefore, the situation must still
      be carefully monitored.
   The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 14.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
      The 7-day incidence exceeded 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 3 districts: the cities of Hamm and
      Remscheid and, the district of Dingolfing-Landau. A total of 10 districts transmitted zero cases over
      the past 7 days.
   The 7-day incidence in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg is considerably higher, and in Bavaria, Hesse and
      North Rhine-Westphalia noticeably higher higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
   In total, 287,421 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,471 deaths associated with COVID-19
      have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
   A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
      clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
      and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational
      settings, and among travellers.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 29/09/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The 4-day R-value is slightly above 1 since the
      second week of September.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees.
      The current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can only be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection control, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces and,
      where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should
      be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 287,421
  (+2,089) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI. A total of 10 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days; however on 16/06/2020 a total of 139
  districts reported zero cases.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 107,060 cases (37%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (29/09/2020, 12:00 AM).

  The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 2 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
  the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
  proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
  from reporting week 17 to reporting week 24, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
  cases. This development continued in the following weeks. By comparison, the proportion of cases in the
  younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
  decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
  a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations. However, as of week 32 the proportion of cases among 10
  to 29 year olds increased. Absolute case numbers increased from week 29 to 34, stabilizing until week
  36. Since reporting week 37, however, case numbers have increased again, with a slight increase in the
  proportion of cases among older age groups, which has, however, stabilized in week 39.
  Figure 3: Presentation of the notified COVID-19 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants in Germany by age group and reporting week
  (29/09/2020, 12 AM)
  Figure 3 shows that at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, COVID-19 incidence increased initially
  among 15-34 year olds and 35-59 year olds, followed by older persons over 80 years of age. After the
  decline in incidence for all age groups, the highest incidence since the renewed increase in case numbers
  is currently seen in the age group of 15 to 34-year-olds, followed by the age group of 5 to 14-year-olds
  and now also the 35-59-year-olds. The incidence increased among persons 60 years of age and older
  from weeks 36 to 38 and it plateaued in week 39.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 233,816 (81%) of the notified cases. Among these, cough
  (43%), fever (36%), rhinorrhoea (21%) and sore throat (20%) were reported most and 14% had no or no
  relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Pneumonia was reported in 5,769 cases (2%). Since calendar week 17,
  cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and
  anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in 14,693
  of 89,234 cases (16%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 34,522 (14%) of 244,488 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 254,200 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

  Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The proportion of
  deaths among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it decreased
  markedly until week 34 and has remained well under 1% since then. The proportion of cases reported
  with no or no symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until week 21 at 26%, and fluctuated
  thereafter only slightly until week 31. Following, the proportion increased to 35% in week 34, but
  decreased since then to 19% in weeks 38 and 39. During the weeks with the highest proportion of cases
  with no or no symptoms relevant for COVID-19, the proportion of cases with exposure in a country other
  than Germany was also highest (see Figure 5).

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to day of death are shown by calendar week in Figure 4.
  Of all deaths, 8,076 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 14% of all cases were in this
  age group (Table 3). Thus far, two deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for both of them. The number of
  deaths may change after data validation is completed.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 26% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 4).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
  place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of
  reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting a
  probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined
  again since, to currently 9% (Figure 5). In weeks 36-39, 8,041 persons reported a possible site of infection
  abroad.
  Table 5 lists the top 16 countries in addition to Germany most frequently reported as the probable place
  of infection in weeks 36 to 39. Turkey, the Western Balkan countries, Romania, Czech Republic, France,
  Italy, Spain, Austria and Hungary were most frequently reported as the country of exposure.

  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad increased significantly after the
  opening of borders in calendar week 25, but has been declining again since week 35 (see Figure 5).
  Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be
  greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and hygiene and
  avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
  immediately. In addition, travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
  maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 37 districts,
  including the cities of Hamm and Remscheid and the district of Dingolfing-Landau with 7-day incidences
  of > 25 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to 180 cases in connection with a wedding.
  More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine (https://www.hamm.de/corona).
  Stricter distancing measures have been implemented in Hamm
  (https://www.hamm.de/aktuelles/weitere-corona-massnahmen-beschlossen).

   The 7-day incidence in the city of Remscheid again increased to over 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants on
   25/09/2020. The majority of current cases are minor incidents in day care centres and schools as well as
   contact persons to the confirmed cases. Stricter control measures have been implemented
   (https://remscheid.de/corona#chapter146380100000143530-1015_sp_main_iterate_1_0).
   The increased incidence in Dingolfing-Landau is mainly explained by a COVID-19 outbreak at an industrial
   company and associated logistic partners. Mass testing was implemented. The district administration has
   decreed the implementation stricter control measures (https://www.landkreis-dingolfing-
   landau.de/media/3063/allgemeinverfuegung-ldl-20200925.pdf).
   Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to transmission at family and other private events. The
   proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-19-related
   outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community
   facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.
   Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
   The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
   R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 6) and not directly
   extracted from the notification system.
                          4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                1.12                                                             1.03
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.91 – 1.34)                               (95%-prediction interval: 0.92– 1.15)
   Figure 6: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
   cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
   electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 29/09/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 24/09/2020).
   The reported R values have been predominantly greater than 1 since the second week in September.
   Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
   under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
   https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
   23/04/2020).

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 29/09/2020, a total of 1,286 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,744
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,844 (71%) are occupied, and 8,900 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 1Fehler!

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and
     therefore the number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain
     an occasionally important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or
     deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     epidemiologic situation on 18/09/2020. The current version can be found here: Risk assessment for
