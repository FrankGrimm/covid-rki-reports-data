      COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
      Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
      situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
      – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
      Summary (as of 04/02/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the
          health of the general population to be very high.
      • Yesterday, 14,211 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 786 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 81 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saarland, Saxony,
          Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.
      • In 341 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high. In 110 districts, the 7-day incidence is >100 cases/100,000
          population and in 6 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 64 and of people aged ≥80 years, 147 cases/100,000
          population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 04/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,178 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +623 existing patients had
          been discharged (27 % of whom had died) and +579 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was 44 less than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 2,091,689 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.5%) and
          756.333 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
      • In this situation report, the following additional information is given: information from additional RKI based surveillance systems
          for acute respiratory illness, data on emergency department utilization

  COVID-19 Situation Report 04/02/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI classifies all cases of laboratory
  confirmation via SARS-CoV-2-nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) detection or SARS-CoV-2 isolation as COVID-19
  cases, regardless of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, in the following report the term
  "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers have been slowly decreasing.
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means that although the number of new infections per day is decreasing, it remains high.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number
  of serious cases and deaths remains at a high level. These can only be avoided if all persons prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by wearing a surgical mask or masks marked with N95 or KN95 or FFP2 correctly.
  Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide. Their effect on the spread of SARS-
  CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations on these variants are being examined in detail. Since mid-
  December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United
  Kingdom. There is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. There are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with
  variant B.1.1.7 may lead to more severe diseases. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that mRNA
  vaccine efficacy is unlikely to be strongly affected by variant B.1.1.7.
  Also, in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. For this
  virus variant, too, laboratory tests show that the efficacy of the licensed mRNA vaccines is only minimally
  affected. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of
  Amazonas. Travels, which are non-essential, should be avoided – especially due to the circulation of new
  virus mutations.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection process is
  increasingly monitored through integrated molecular surveillance.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,252,001
  (+14,211) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,167,369 cases (52 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown –
  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (04/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After further case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, while values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently
  estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                 7-day R-value
                                0.78                                                         0.89
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.68 – 0.88)                           (95%-prediction interval: 0.83 – 0.94)

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for cases
  without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset electronically
  reported to RKI (orange) (as of 04/02/2021, 12 AM, considering cases up to 31/01/2021).
  Figure 3: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of the estimated number of
  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 04/02/2021, 12 AM, considering cases up to 31/01/2021).
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means that although the number of new infections per day is decreasing, it remains high.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under http://www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 04/02/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,064 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 22,729 (84 %) are occupied, and 4,335 (16 %) beds are currently available.
     The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2
     Table 2: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) recorded in the DIVI register (04/02/2021, 12:15 PM).

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In week 4, 2021, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) decreased slightly,
     mainly due to a decrease of the ARI rate in adults (aged 15 years and above). The ARI rate has been below
     the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further information can be found under
     https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 4, 2021, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) decreased. Since week 2, 2021, the ARI rate has been on a markedly lower level compared to previous
     years, especially in children under 15 years of age. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory
     viruses were detected in 32 of 158 sentinel samples (20%) in week 4, 2021. Among those, rhinovirus was
     identified in 17 samples (11%), SARS-CoV-2 in 10 samples (6%), human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) in 4
     samples (3%) and parainfluenza virus was found in one sample (1%). Since week 40, 2020, SARS-COV-2 has
     been found in 164 (9%) of 1,928 samples. Sporadic human seasonal coronaviruses (hCoV) have been
     identified since week 2, 2020. Influenza virus or Respiratory Syncitial Virus have been detected none of the
     1,935 samples tested since week 40, 2020. Further information can be found under
     https://influenza.rki.de/.

    A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
    (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
    respiratory tract). In week 3, 2021, the overall number of SARI cases decreased further due to a decrease in
    the age groups 35 years and above. The SARI case numbers in the age groups 35 years and above were
    comparable to the case numbers of previous years, but the number of SARI cases aged under 35 years were
    markedly lower than usual at this time of the year.
    Since week 45, 2020, more than half of the reported SARI cases per week have been diagnosed with COVID-
    19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). In week 3, 2021, the proportion of COVID-19 infections decreased
    slightly to 65%. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age groups can be found in Table 3.
    The proportions of COVID-19 cases in all age groups in the weeks 40, 2020 to 2, 2021 have been more than
    twice as high as in spring (weeks 12 to 20, 2020). In week 3, 2021, the proportion of COVID-19 cases in the
    age groups above 14 years remained high, comprising more than half of the SARI cases in this week. For the
    first time, the proportion of COVID-19 in SARI cases aged between 35 and 59 years was lower than the
    cumulative proportion of previous weeks (weeks 40, 2020 to 2, 2021). Within the 72 sentinel hospitals,
    there was one COVID-19 case among SARI patients below 15 years of age in week 3, 2021. Please note that
    due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation
    duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

 Data on emergency department utilization
    In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/), and
    with the ESEG project partners
    (https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/ESEG/ESEG_node.html), the RKI analyses
    emergency department utilisation, and prepares weekly situation report:
    https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html
    Within the emergency department situation report of the 03 February 2021, data from 22 emergency
    departments have been included from 01 January 2019 up to and including 31 January 2021. In week 4-
    2021, 11,306 admissions were recorded; which was a +0.9% change compared to last week, and a -30.2%
    average change compared to the mean of the pre-pandemic year 2019 (see Figure 5).

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
       population to be very high. The revised version highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-
       CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in nursing and senior care homes, households, and
       occupational settings.
       Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
       rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
       outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
       vulnerable persons.
       On 03/02/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The

 Annex
    1
      The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
      transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
    2
      Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
      number of recovered cases.
    3
      The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
      hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
    4
      Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
      reported.
