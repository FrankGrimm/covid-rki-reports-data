COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide
data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
     – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
     Summary (as of 31/07/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    In the past few weeks, the number of districts that have not reported any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7
          days has decreased clearly. In parallel, the COVID-19 incidence has risen in many federal states. This trend is
          concerning.
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 5.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and thus
          further increased slightly, albeit at a low level. A total of 76 districts transmitted zero cases over the past 7
          days. Moreover, in 209 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
     •    In total, 208,698 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,141 deaths due to COVID-19 have been
          electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
     •    In the Bavarian district of Dingolfing-Landau a COVID-19 related outbreak occurred with >150 cases among
          harvest workers of an agricultural company. The entire company with over 450 employees is under
          quarantine.
     •    Moreover, COVID-19-related outbreaks occur in various settings, including nursing homes and hospitals,
          facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, as well as in context of religious or family events.
     •    Due to technical problems today the sections for the demographic distribution of cases and deaths and for
          the occupation, accommodation or care in facilities are not reported.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 31/07/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      An increase in COVID-19 case numbers since last week occurred in many of the federal states.
      Nationwide, there are many smaller case outbreaks in different administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, but also in community and
      health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified among people returning
      from travel abroad.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since last week. This development is very
      concerning and will continue to be monitored very closely by the RKI. A further worsening of the
      situation must be avoided. This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to
      decreasing transmission, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also in outdoor
      settings -, by airing indoor areas and, where necessary, wearing a community or face mask correctly.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 208,698
      (+870) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see Table 1). A total of 76 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts that have not submitted any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has
      decreased continuously; on 12th July still, the number of districts reporting zero cases was 125.
      Figure 1: Number and cumulative incidence (per 100,000 population) of the 208,698 electronically reported COVID-19 cases in
      Germany by county and federal state (31/07/20220, 12:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
      information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).

   Distribution of cases over time
   The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
   RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
   unknown in 64,564 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.
   Figure 2: Number of Covid-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or –if
   unknown- alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (31/07/2020, 12:00 AM).
   Clinical aspects
   Information on symptoms is available for 177,528 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
   cough (47%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,254 cases (3.0%). Since
   calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
   ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
   reported in 5,026 of 33,511 cases (15%).
   Hospitalisation was reported for 30,626 (17%) of 181,816 COVID-19 cases with information on
   hospitalisation status.
   Approximately 192,300 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
   recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
   In total, 9,141 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.4% of all confirmed cases).
   Of these, 5,054 (55%) are men and 4,082 (45%) are women, the gender was unknown in five cases.
   The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,813 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only
   18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of
   age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.
   Outbreaks
  Three districts reported an increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the districts
  of Dingolfing-Landau and Hof in Bavaria and the district Dithmarschen in Schleswig-Holstein.
  A high 7-day incidence with more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed In the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau. The increase is due to an outbreak among harvest workers of an agricultural

    company. Among more than 450 employees, >150 SARS-CoV-2-infections were identified. Quarantine
    was ordered for the entire company. The local population (3,300 inhabitants) has been offered
    voluntary testing.
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
    Hof (Bavaria). Several events are responsible for this increase. An outbreak in a large family has
    extended to several families in neighbouring communities. Another outbreak is related to a family event
    including individuals from Hof district as well as Weimar district in Thuringia. Together with another
    family-related outbreak, this explains the currently increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases per 100.000
    inhabitants in Weimar district. Due to ongoing screening activites, further cases can be expected.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 3 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among

      affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
      relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.06 (95%-prediction interval: 0.82 – 1.30) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 31/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.19 (95% prediction
     interval: 1.05 – 1.31) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 31/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported 7-day R value has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is due to a
     larger number of small outbreaks, but also case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
     steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures.

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 31/07/2020, a total of 1,277 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 33,335 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 21,693 (65%) are occupied, and 11,642 beds (35%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.

  Mortality Monitoring
      A total of 24 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
      excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
      the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
      (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data,
      have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
      monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
      All-cause mortality for the countries in the EuroMOMO network has now returned to normal levels,
      following a period of a substantial excess mortality coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess
      mortality was observed primarily in the age group of over-65-years-old, but also in the age group of 15-
      64-years-old.
      Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with
      a certain time lag. A special evaluation on excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
      https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-
      Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html (in German).
      Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there is no noticeable increase in the number of
      deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, the mortality figures were
      significantly above the average of previous years; since the beginning of May, the mortality figures have
      been back to around the average.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
      mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
      transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
      again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
      available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
      as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks).
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.

     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
