COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
 – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
 Summary (as of 21/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
 • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore,
     the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
 • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 51.3 cases per 100,000 population.
 • The 7-day incidence is considerably higher in Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland, and
     moderately higher in Bavaria than the national average 7-day incidence.
 • The number of districts with an increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants continues to rise,
     to 285 urban and rural districts. Of these, 30 districts have an incidence of > 100 cases/100,000 population and
     104 districts have an incidence of > 50-100 cases/100,000 population.
 • Since the beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again (ref.
     Daily Situation Report of 20.10.2020).
 • A number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are being
     reported particularly in the context of family events, and in nursing homes.
 • In total, 380,762 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,875 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
     transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 21/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in nearly all federal states. The
      proportion of COVID-19 cases in the older age groups is currently increasing. Since the start of October,
      R-values have been clearly above 1.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Since end July, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below 1% and is
      thus markedly lower than in the spring, particularly in April (ref. Daily Situation Report of 20 Oct 2020).
      However, it is regarded as implausible that the virus has become less pathogenic. Rather, the low
      proportion of deaths can be explained as follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred
      mainly among young people, who most of the time experience a less severe course of disease. On the
      other hand there is also broader testing, which means more milder cases are identified.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.
      The National Testing Strategy was updated on the basis of an ordinance on testing for SARS-CoV-2 which
      has entered into force on 15 October 2020. The overall objective of the National Testing Strategy
      remains the care for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the protection of vulnerable groups and the
      prevention of the spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The update includes the targeted use of antigen
      testing and the extension of testing to more population groups.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 380,762
  (+7,595) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown for 158,352 cases (42%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

    unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (21/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
    information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
    reported COVID-19 cases.
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 34% of cases;
    the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
    according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
    The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
    Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
    Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
    care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
    The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
    outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 285 districts,
  including 30 urban and rural districts with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 103
  districts with a 7-day incidences of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with occasional clustering in the context of celebrations with
  family and friends. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large increases
  in the concerned districts. However, many small outbreaks in old people’s and nursing homes, in
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, and community facilities, kindergartens and
  schools, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to
  the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
  extracted from the notification system.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
     less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 21/10/2020, a total of 1,285 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 29,895
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,417 (72%) are occupied, and 8,478 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
    number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
    important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
    before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    To assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
    clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
    survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
    Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
    the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 42/2020, 20,380,376 laboratory tests
    have been recorded to date, 418,871 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Up to and including week 42, 253 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
    one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the
    ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the
    same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients
    (Table 4 with data for the last 10 weeks – complete data since beginning of testing are available at
    www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German)).

      Testing of travellers at German Points of Entry (PoE)
      At several points of entry (airports, train stations, motorway service stations), SARS-CoV-2 test centres
      have been established. Some of the laboratories attached to those test centres have voluntarily provided
      aggregated statistics on the number of tests. For week 42/2020, 44,129 tests were reported from these
      entry points, of which 738 were positive (1.67%). It is not possible to say to which extent these 44,129
      tests are included in those reported in Table 4.
      Some PoE testing centres have stopped reporting, others have closed, yet others have been re-organised
      and now participate in the testing of other population groups (e.g. of contact persons). An unambiguous
      assessment of testing travellers entering Germany is therefore no longer possible, and reporting will
      cease from next calendar week.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
