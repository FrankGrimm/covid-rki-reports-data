COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 20/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly in many federal states and the
             number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased
             considerably. This trend is very concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 9.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus remains at an increased level. A total of only 23 districts transmitted zero cases over the
             past 7 days. In further 129 districts the 7-day-incidence is equal or below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In Hesse, North Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria, Berlin and Rhineland - Palatinate the 7-day incidence is
             in part considerably higher than the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 228,621 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,253 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    The new cases are distributed nationwide and occur increasingly among travellers but also in the
             context of events with family and friends.
        •    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including nursing
             homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-
             processing plants, agricultural and other occupational settings, as well as in the context of religious
             events.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 20/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. It is noticeable that the average age of infection has decreased over the past few
      weeks, that the incidence particularly in younger age groups has increased and is much higher than in
      older age groups.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many small outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various
      settings, such as larger events with family and friends. In addition, a large percentage of COVID-19 cases
      are being identified among travellers entering Germany, especially among younger age groups.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is very concerning and increasing in dynamic. A further worsening of the situation must be avoided. On
      the one hand, the increase in younger age groups needs to be stopped, on the other hand, transmission
      into older and vulnerable groups needs to be prevented. As soon as the number of infections rises
      among elderly people, hospitalisations and number of deaths will likely rise as well. This can only be
      prevented if the entire population continues to be committed to decreasing transmission, e.g. by
      consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also outdoors -, by airing indoor areas
      and, where indicated, by wearing a community or face mask correctly. Large gatherings – especially
      indoors – should be avoided, and events with family and friends should be limited to close family
      members and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Since January 2020, a total of 228,621 (+1,707) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been
      electronically reported to and validated by the RKI (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 23 districts
      reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks, the number of districts not transmitting any
      COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days decreased continuously; on 12/07/2020 the number of districts
      reporting zero cases still amounted to 125 districts.
      Figure 1: Number and cumulative incidence (per 100,000 population) of the 228,621 electronically reported COVID-19 cases in
      Germany by county and federal state (20/08/2020, 00:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for
      information on number of COVID-19 cases by district (local health authority).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 76,115 cases (33%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (20/08/2020, 12:00 AM).

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 7,626 were children under 10 years of age (3.3%), 13,970 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (6.1%), 104,348 persons aged 20 to 49 years (46%), 64,785 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (28%), 31,729 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,534 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.4%). Age and/or gender were unknown in 629 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 46 years
  (median age 46 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

  cases with information available (20/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 191,285 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (46%), fever (39%), rhinorrhoea (20%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,382 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 7.122 of 46,981 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 31.779 (16%) of 198,022 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 204,800 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,253 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.0% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,125 (55%) are men and 4,124 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases. The mean age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 81 years (median: 82 years). Of all
  deaths, 7,911 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age
  group. Thus far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the
  RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

  IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
  care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
  persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in
  meat processing plants.

    COVID-19 Situation Report 20/08/2020
6
    Outbreaks
    Twelve districts reported an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants. The federal
    states mainly affected are North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Bavaria. The increased incidence in the
    affected districts is mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad but also in the context
    of family events and other private events.
    The high incidence in the district of Dingolfing-Landau, caused by an outbreak on an agricultural farm
    with an attached canning factory is decresasing.
    Further COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings, including nursing
    homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-processing
    plants, agricultural and other occupational settings, as well as in the context of religious events.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 20/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 16/08/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.

     The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.04 (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 – 1.26) and is based on
     electronically notified cases as of 20/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
     compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
     of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.14 (95% prediction
     interval: 1,02 – 1.27) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 20/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
     The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. According to current
     observations, this seems to be associated to a great extent with an increasing number of cases among
     travel returnees, a larger number of smaller outbreaks and the overall case numbers in Germany, which
     have increased steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of disease control measures.

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 20/08/2020, a total of 1,281 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
     30,662 intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,011 (72%) are occupied, and 8,651 (28%) are
     currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

  Information from additional RKI based surveillance
       systems for actue respiratory illnesses
      GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
      (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 33, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
      stable. Further information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
      The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
      practices. In week 33, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
      increased slightly. The ARI incidence decreased in nearly all age groups but increased in the age group 5
      to 14 years. Overall, it remained at a low level, similar to the level of previous seasons at this time of the
      year. Within the viral surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 8 of 18 sentinel samples (44%)
      in week 33, 2020. Since week 16, 2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected within the viral sentinel
      surveillance of the AGI. Further information can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.
      A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
      patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
      the lower respiratory tract). In week 32, 2020, the total number of SARI cases decreased. Of all reported
      SARI cases in week 32, 2020, 5% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (see Figure 5).
      Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main
      diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.
      Figure 5: Weekly number of SARI cases (ICD-10 codes J09-J22) and proportion of cases with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10
      code U07.1!) among SARI cases with duration of hospitalisation of up to one week and with date of admission in weeks 12 to
      32, 2020, from 70 sentinel hospitals

  Data on emergency department utilisation
      In collaboration with the National Emergency Department Register AKTIN (https://www.aktin.org/en/),
      the RKI analysed emergency department utilisation and prepared a weekly situation report:
      https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Div32/sumo/sumo.html
      As of 16-08-2020, data from 9 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between 01-11-
      2019 and 01-03-2020, an average of 6,356 emergency department admissions per week was recorded.
      From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was observed,
      to 3,697 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable surveillance systems
      in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions, public measures were
      taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase in admissions has been
      observed. In week 33, 2020, 6,058 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the number of admissions is
      currently 5% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see Figure 6).

      average of 9 emergency departments; relative deviation to the reference period 01/11/2019 – 01-03-2020 (as of 16/08/2020)
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
      mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing with a clear
      acceleration in recent weeks. At the same time, the number of districts that have not reported any cases
      in the last 7 days is decreasing. There are larger and smaller outbreaks nationwide, especially in
      connection with celebrations in the circle of family and friends and at group events. Travel returnees,
      especially in the younger age groups, also contribute to the increase in the number of cases. Vaccines
      and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of
      the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
      short notice based on new insights.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     Infection risk
     SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
     the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
     measures and community masks). Here, contacts in risk situations (such as long face-to-face contact)
     play a special role. Aerosol emission increases sharply when speaking loudly, singing or laughing. In
     indoor rooms, this significantly increases the risk of transmission, even if a distance of more than 1.5 m
     is maintained. If the minimum distance of 1.5 m without covering the mouth and nose is not
     maintained, e.g. when groups of people sit at a table or in large gatherings, there is also an increased
     risk of transmission outdoors.
     Disease severity
     In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
     increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet. The
     individual risk cannot be derived from epidemiological/statistical data. Thus, even without known
     previous illnesses and in young people, the course of the disease can be severe or even life-threatening.
     Long-term consequences, even after slight progressions, cannot yet be assessed.
     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
