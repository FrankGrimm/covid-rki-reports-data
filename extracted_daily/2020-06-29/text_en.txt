    information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown in 57,661 cases (30%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

    on gender was reported, 4,750 were children under 10 years of age (2.5%), 9,298 children and teenagers
    aged 10 to 19 years (4.8%), 84,869 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 58,968 persons aged 50 to 69
    years (30%), 30,117 persons aged 70 to 89 years (16%) and 5,340 persons aged 90 years and older
    (2.8%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 419 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 49 years
    (median age 49 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure 3).

    cases with information available (29/06/2020,12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 165,662 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (49%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,019 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,293 of 22,524 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,181 (17%) of 168,565 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 178,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 8,961 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,960 (55%) are men and 3,996 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,680 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,806 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in three districts,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia), and the cities of Coburg (Bavaria) and Delmenhorst
    (Lower Saxony).
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
    processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
    for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are in
    quarantine together with their household members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the
    district of Guetersloh were closed on 18/06/2020 until the end of the summer holidays (11/08/2020), in
    the neighboring district of Warendorf since 25/06/2020. On 23/06/2020, the state of North Rhine-
    Westphalia officially implemented the second stage of a lockdown for the districts of Guetersloh and
    Warendorf until 30/06/2020. Widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented in the affected
    region. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in the food retail sector, kiosk staff and residents of
    central shared accommodations are being tested in Gütersloh and Warendorf. Any resident can have a
    test performed free of charge.
    Currently, two further outbreaks in other meat processing plants are ongoing in the district of Wesel in
    Nort Rhine-Westphalia and the district of Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. Both plants were temporarily
    closed. The high 7-day incidence in Delmenhorst is related to the outbreak in Oldenburg, as COVID-19
    infected workers live in the neighboring district.
    An outbreak among a religious community in Coburg resulted in an increase of the 7-day incidence.
    A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals as well as refugee
    facilities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

      Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for

      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 29/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 25/06/2020).
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.74 (95%-prediction interval: 0.61 – 0.85)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 29/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.63 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.58 – 0.69) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 29/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
      After a temporary marked increase in the estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value),
      they have again decreased to a value of 1 or below over the past few days. The marked increase over
      the preceding days was related to increased case numbers mainly due to local, outbreak-related COVID-
      19 transmission with the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role (see
      section “Outbreaks”, above). The outbreak dynamics are also influenced in part by serial tests
      performed among possibly exposed persons, which led to the rapid detection of large numbers of
      additional COVID-19 cases in some of the outbreak settings. Since the case numbers in Germany are at a
      low level overall, local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction
      number. For this reason, the reproduction numbers may continue to fluctuate markedly.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

  DIVI intensive care register
       A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
       RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
       number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
       hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       As of 29/06/2020, a total of 1,270 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,387
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,387 (63%) are occupied, and 12,000 beds (37%) are
       currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
       differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
       discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
