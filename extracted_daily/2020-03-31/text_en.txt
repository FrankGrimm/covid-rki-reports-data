  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 00:00 AM daily).
      Since 27/01/2020, a total of 61,913 (+4,615) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 583 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at

    Germany by county and federal state (31/03/2020, 00:00 AM). Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/)
    for information on number of COVID-19-cases by county (local health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 30/03/2020. In 25,654 cases, onset
    of symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    with information available (31/03/2020, 00:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 44,323 of the notified cases. The most common
    manifestations are cough (23,532; 53%), fever (18,346; 41%), rhinorrhoea (10,100; 23%) and
    pneumonia (867; 2%). Hospitalisation is reported for 5,623 (13%) of 44,775 COVID-19 cases with
    information on hospitalisation available.
    An estimated 16,100 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases were considered to
    have recovered if they had a known symptom onset on or before 17/03/2020, were not reported to
    have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged and did
    not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of symptom onset,
    symptoms, hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
    The 583 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 384 (66%) men
    and 198 (34%) women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 104 years. Of all deaths, 507
    (87%) were in persons 70 years or older. Of all reported cases only 12% were 70 years or older.
    Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In these outbreaks the case
    fatality is high. In some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively high.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe
      and fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population
      overall as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression
      increases with increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region.
      The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases,
      health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing
      etc.), and may be very high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice
      as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    International risk areas
      -     The following countries and regions are classified as international risk areas (29/03/2020)
            (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete.html):
                 o Austria
                 o Egypt
                 o Iran
                 o Italy
                 o France
                 o In South Korea: The province of Gyeongsangbuk-do (North-Gyeongsang)
                 o     Spain
                 o In Switzerland: the cantons of Tessin, Waadt and Geneva
                 o In the United States: The states of California, Washington, New York and New Jersey
      The province of Hubei in China is no longer classified as an international risk area.
    Other measures
      -     Field teams of the RKI support outbreak containment measures with a focus on outbreaks in
            retirement and health care homes as well as hospitals in several federal states.
      -     Since 31.03.2020, the RKI no longer identifies particularly affected areas in Germany, as COVID-19
            is now widespread throughout Germany. In many districts there are outbreaks, some with large
            case numbers. Data on current disease activity in the districts can be found on the dashboard and
            in the daily situation reports.
      -     A new federal law was implemented on 28/03/2020 for the protection of the public in the event of
            epidemic situations, granting the federal government additional competencies for the control of
            epidemics. https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2020/1-
            quartal/corona-gesetzespaket-im-bundesrat.html
      -     As of 23 March 2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and
            household members) are banned in all federal states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with
            body care were closed. In public spaces , all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to
            other indivduals https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/besprechung-
