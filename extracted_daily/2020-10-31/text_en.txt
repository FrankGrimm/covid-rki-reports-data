COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 31/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire
     population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased further to 110.9 cases per 100,000 population.
  • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
     incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 71.6 cases/100.000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia is higher than the national total 7-day
     incidence.
  • The number of districts with an increased 7-day incidence of >25 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants continues to rise. Only 7
     districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of today, 155 districts have an incidence of >50-100
     cases/100,000 population, 186 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and 19 districts have an
     incidence of >200 cases/100,000 population.
  • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with a large number of clusters in connection with
     private gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in educational settings, and nursing and long-term care homes,
     as well as in occupational settings or related to religious events.
  • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has more than doubled in the past 2 weeks from 730 patients on
     17/10/2020 to 1,944 patients on 31/10/2020.
  • In total, 518,753 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,452 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
     to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 31/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values have been stable
      since the beginning of October, well above 1. Since the beginning of this week, a slight downward trend
      has been observed.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 518,753
  (+19,059) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  COVID-19 Situation Report 31/10/2020

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 244,432 cases (47 %), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (31/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 45% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 405 districts,
  including 186 urban and rural districts with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000 population and 155
  districts with a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with a large number of clusters in
  connection with private gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in educational settings, and
  nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to religious events.
  In most districts, transmission is diffuse, with numerous outbreaks related to celebrations with family
  and friends, but also increasingly occurring in educational settings and retirement and nursing homes. In
  a few districts, larger outbreaks have been the cause for marked increases in COVID-19 cases. Numerous
  smaller outbreaks also continue to be reported in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and
  refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings, all
  contributing to the increasing incidence.

     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.
                             4-day R-value                                                    7-day R-value
                                   1.11                                                             1.19
             (95%-prediction interval: (0.89 - 1.33)                            (95%-prediction interval: 1.06 – 1.32)
     Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
     less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
     Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
     cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
     electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 31/10/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 27/10/2020).
     Since the start of October, the R-values have been well above 1. Since the beginning of this week, a slight
     downward trend has been observed.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
     23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

     As of 31/10/2020, a total of 1,282 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,970
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,286 (73%) are occupied, and 7,684 (27%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     epidemiologic situation on 26/10/2020. The current version can be found here:
