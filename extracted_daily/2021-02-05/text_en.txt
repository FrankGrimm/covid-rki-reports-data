      Summary (as of 05/02/2021, 12:00 AM)
      • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the
          health of the general population to be very high.
      • Yesterday, 12,908 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 855 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
          transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 80 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saarland, Saxony,
          Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is well above the national incidence.
      • In 338 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 109 districts, the 7-day
          incidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in 7 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
      • The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 63 and of people aged ≥80 years, 142 cases/100,000
          population.
      • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
          households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
      • On 05/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,072 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +598 existing patients
          had been discharged (29 % of whom had died) and +492 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
          treatment was 106 less than the prior day.
      • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 2,153,000 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.6%) and
          834.398 people twice (vaccination rate 1.0%) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
      • In this situation report, the following additional information is given: mortality monitoring.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 05/02/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI classifies all cases of
  laboratory confirmation via SARS-CoV-2-nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) detection or SARS-CoV-2 isolation as
  COVID-19 cases, regardless of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, in the following report
  the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  After a sharp rise in case numbers at the beginning of December, a decrease during the holidays and an
  increase in the first week of January the case numbers have been slowly decreasing.
  The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany,
  this means that although the number of new infections per day is decreasing, it remains high.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the
  number of serious cases and deaths remains at a high level. These can only be avoided if all persons
  prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
  control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor
  spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a surgical mask or masks marked with N95 or KN95 or FFP2
  correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide. Their effect on the spread of
  SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of vaccinations on these variants are being examined in detail. Since
  mid-December there have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the
  United Kingdom. There is increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased
  infectiousness of this variant. There are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with
  variant B.1.1.7 may lead to more severe diseases. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that mRNA
  vaccine efficacy is unlikely to be strongly affected by variant B.1.1.7.
  Also, in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was
  reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased infectiousness is conceivable. For
  this virus variant, too, laboratory tests show that the efficacy of the licensed mRNA vaccines is only
  minimally affected. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the
  Brazilian state of Amazonas. Travels, which are non-essential, should be avoided – especially due to the
  circulation of new virus mutations.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data
  acquisition in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH -
  https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/DESH.html) the infection process
  is increasingly monitored through integrated molecular surveillance.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 2,264,909
  (+12,908) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

    Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if unknown
    – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (05/02/2021, 12:00 AM).
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
    shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the
    last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
    given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
    the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the
    beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the
    real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The
    currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                                            4-day R-value                                                 7-day R-value
                                                 0.88                                                          0.93
                                 (95%-prediction interval: 0.75 – 1.01)                        (95%-prediction interval: 0.86 – 1.01)
    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
    less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    The R-value is currently slightly below 1. Due to the still very high number of infected persons in Germany,
    this means that although the number of new infections per day is decreasing, it remains high.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 05/02/2021

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
     hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 05/02/2021, a total of 1,281 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 27,003 intensive care
     beds were registered, of which 22,663 (84 %) are occupied, and 4,340 (16 %) beds are currently available.
     The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Mortality Monitoring
     At the time of preparing the Covid-19 Situation Report, there was no update of the data from Destatis.
     As a result, you will find the data as of January 29, 2021, below.
     A total of 27 European countries or regions provide the European EuroMOMO project (European
     monitoring of excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis
     which allows the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and
     pandemics (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission
     of data have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
     monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
     An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
     April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also among
     those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain,
     Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. After a return to expected levels for most countries in May (with the
     exception of a heat-related peak in August), total all-cause mortality in the reporting countries has again
     increased above expected levels since calendar week 38. Mortality is particularly high in Austria, Belgium,
     France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. The excess all-cause mortality is
     seen primarily in the age group of 45 years and above.
     Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with a
     certain time lag. Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase
     in the number of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality
     was considerably higher than the average of previous years; since the beginning of May, mortality

     decreased to expected levels, with the exception of a heat-related increase in August. In September,
     however, deaths again increased to 5% above the expected number based on the mean number of deaths
     observed from 2016 to 2019. In calendar week 53 (28/12/21 – 03/01/2021), 24,531 persons died (-287
     compared to week 52). This is 31% more deaths than the average of the 4 previous years. In the previous
     week, the number of deaths exceeded the average for the previous years by 31%.

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the
     general population to be very high. The revised version highlights the ongoing community transmission of
     SARS-CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in nursing and senior care homes,
     households, and occupational settings.
     Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
     rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to
     contain outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to
     protect vulnerable persons.
     On 03/02/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
     current version can be found here:

  Annex
     1
       The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
       transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
     2
       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
       number of recovered cases.
     3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
       hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
     4
       Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
       reported.
