  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 155,193 (+1,018) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 5,750 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and https://corona.rki.de.

4  COVID-19 Situation Report 27/04/2020
    Since international travel restrictions have been in place, the number and proportion of COVID-19 cases
    exposed abroad has declined sharply (see Figure 2). Currently, only isolated cases are reported for which a
    probable exposure abroad is indicated.
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 53,193 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).
    Figure 2: Number of electronically reported COVID-19 cases in Germany by date of symptom onset and alternatively by date of
    reporting from 01/03/2020 (27/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among notified cases, 2,610 were children under 10
    years of age (1.7%), 6,454 children and youth aged 10 to 19 years (4.2%), 66,482 persons aged 20 to 49
    years (43%), 50,194 persons aged 50 to 69 years (32%), 24,940 persons aged 70 to 89 years (16%) and
    4,321 persons aged 90 years and older (2.8%). The age of 191 notified cases is unknown. The middle age
    of cases is 50 years (median 50 years). The highest incidences are in the age groups above 90 years (see
    Figure 3), with only 2.8% of reported cases.

    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 124,055 (80%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (50%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 3,345 cases (2.7%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 21,181 (17%) of 123,520 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 114,500 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. As the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of recovered
    cases.
    The 5,750 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 3,263 (57%) men and 2,482 (43%)
    women (sex was unknown in 5 cases) (Table 2). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 4,993 (87%)
    were in persons 70 years or older, but only 19% of all cases were in this age group. COVID-19 related
    outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals. In some of these outbreaks, the
    number of deaths is relatively high.

  Occupation, accomodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Infection Against Protection Law (IfSG), information on occupation, accomodation
    or care in a facility relevant for infection control is documented and electronically transmitted to RKI for
    notified COVID-19 cases (Table 3).
    Thus far, 8,808 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reportedly working in medical facilities, 72% were
    female and 28% male. The median age was 41 years. Hospitalisation was reported for 383 of 8,808 cases
    among staff working in medical facilities with information available (4,3%). There were 13 COVID-19
    related deaths among staff working in medical facilities.The proportion of cases reported as working in
    medical facilities among all cases increased over time from at least 3.7% in Week 12, 5.0% in Week 13,
    5.8% in Week 14, 7.0% in Week 15 to 7.5% in Week 16, 2020, in Week 17 at least 6,0%. Due to missing
    data on occupation 41% of cases, the true proportion of cases working in medical facilities may be higher.
    The high number of case among persons cared for or working in various care facilities is consistent with
    the numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases attending or
    working in facilities concerned with child care or education reflects that children are not as affected.
    The proportion of persons with COVID-19 reported as working in the above facilities who actually
    acquired their infection in these settings is unknown.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R can only be estimated
    and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R= 1.0 (95% confidence
    interval: 0.8-1.1) and is based on current electronically notified cases (27/04/2020, 12:00 A.M.) and an
    assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were
    excluded from the estimation as their low number due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable
    estimate. For more details on the methodology see Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 (in German)
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html
    DIVI intensive care register
    A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
    RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document the capacities for intensive
    care as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals. The DIVI intensive care
    register documents the number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis.
    Since 16/04/2020, reporting is compulsory for all hospital sites with intensive care beds.
    As of 27/04/2020, a total of 1,236 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 31,516
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 18,727 (59%) are occupied, and 12,789 beds (41%) are
    currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals are shown in Table 3.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
      -     Data on current disease activity can be found in the daily situation reports and on the RKI dashboard
            https://corona.rki.de/.
      -     RKI teams are currently supporting outbreak containment measures with a focus on outbreaks in
            retirement and health care homes as well as hospitals in several federal states.
      -     As of 23/03/2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and household
            members) are banned in all federal states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with body care
            were closed. In public spaces, all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to other indivduals

            mit-den-regierungschefinnen-und-regierungschefs-der-laender-1733248 (in German)
      -     A new federal law was implemented on 28/03/2020 for the protection of the public in the event of
            epidemic situations, granting the federal government additional competencies for the control of
            epidemics: https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2020/1-
            quartal/corona-gesetzespaket-im-bundesrat.html (in German)
      -     On 15/04/2020, the German government and the federal states agreed to gradually reduce social
            distancing measures https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/fahrplan-
            corona-pandemie-1744202 (in German)
      -     All federal states implemented regulations to wear (non-medical) face masks, mostly starting as of
            27.4.2020 (partly earlier). With exception of the federal state of Berlin, this is applied to public
            transport and at retail in all states; in Berlin the regulation applies to public transport, and there is a
            recommendation for retail (but no mandatory regulation).
