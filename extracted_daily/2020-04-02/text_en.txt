  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the

    Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for information on number of COVID-19-cases by county (local
    health authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    First COVID-19-cases were notified in Germany in January 2020. In 29,594 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 52% are male and 48% are female. Among notified cases, there are 551 children
    under 5 years of age, 1,431 children aged 5 to 14 years, 54,599 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 13,715
    aged 60 to 79 years and 4,469 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 188 notified
    cases is unknown. The median age of cases is 49 years.

    with information available (02/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 53,351 of the notified cases. The most common
    manifestations are cough (53%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (23%). For 1,132 cases, development of
    pneumonia is known (2%). Hospitalisation is reported for 7,216 (13%) of 54,034 COVID-19 cases with
    information on hospitalisation available.
    An estimated 21,400 persons have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Cases were considered to
    have recovered if they had a known symptom onset on or before 19/03/2020, were not reported to
    have pneumonia or dyspnea, did not require hospitalisation or had already been discharged and did
    not die. Cases were included in the algorithm only if information on date of symptom onset,
    symptoms, hospitalisation status and vital status were available.
    The 872 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 567 (65%) men
    and 304 (35%) women. The median age was 82 years and the range 28 to 105 years. Of all deaths, 751
    (86%) were in persons 70 years or older. Of all reported cases only 12% were 70 years or older.
    Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In these outbreaks the case
    fatality is high. In some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively high.

    Laboratory tests
    RKI launched a nationwide laboratory survey to determine the number of laboratory tests being
    performed for SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. This survey is supplemented by 3 further data collections from
    the Network for Respiratory Diseases (RespVir, RKI), the national network for the surveillance of
    antibiotic resistance in Germany (ARS, RKI) and the Association of Accredited Medical Laboratories in
    Germany (ALM e.V.). From the response of participating laboratories thus far, a total of at least
    918,460 samples were tested up to week 13/2020. Of these, 64,906 samples (7,1%) tested positive for
    SARS-CoV-2.

    Results from other RKI surveillance systems on acute respiratory diseases
    In GrippeWeb, the participatory web portal that monitors the activity of acute respiratory diseases in
    Germany on population level uses information from the population itself. The system reports that the
    rate of acute respiratory diseases (ARE rate) and also the rate of influenza-like diseases (ILI rate) in
    week 13 of 2020 has decreased substantially 3 weeks in a row. The contact-reducing measures, which
    are carried out throughout Germany, seem to lead to a marked reduction of the transmission of acute
    respiratory diseases. Further information is available at https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
    In primary care practices, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza (AGI) monitors acute respiratory diseases
    with its network of primary care sentinel physicians. In week 13 of 2020 a significant decrease in
    practice consultations due to acute respiratory diseases was observed in all age groups. The AGI has
    expanded the virological surveillance to include SARS-CoV-2. Since week 8 of 2020, a total of 8 SARS-
    CoV-2 positive samples have been detected in the AGI sentinel. In week 13, SARS-CoV-2 was identified

      compared to the previous week. Further information is available at https://influenza.rki.de/.
      Within the ICD-10 code-based hospital surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), 7% of
      the reported SARI cases received a COVID-19 diagnosis in week 12 of 2020. 16% and 13% of the SARI
      cases in the age groups 35 to 59 years and 60 to 79 years had received a COVID-19 diagnosis (Table 5).
      There were no COVID-19 cases in the child age groups.

  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe
      and fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population
      overall as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression
      increases with increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region.
      The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases,
      health care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing
      etc.), and may be very high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice
      as a result of new findings.
