  The difference to previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay of data transmission former cases may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
    – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
    Summary (as of 11/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
        strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 138.1 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 94.5 cases/100.000 population.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Saxony is higher than the
        national total 7-day incidence.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 6 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
        today, 36 districts have an incidence of >25-50 cases /100,000 population, 99 districts have an incidence of >50-100
        cases/100,000 population, 271 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 16 districts have
        an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
    • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
        gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as
        in occupational settings or related to religious events.
    • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has increased in the past 2 weeks from 1,569 patients on
        28/10/2020 to 3,127 patients on 11/11/2020.
    • On 11/11/2020, 18,487 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 261 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
        transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 11/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating and is
      currently below 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still
      a high number of new cases every day.
      The data table on page 1 was adapted. The aim of the change is to focus on the current situation
      primarily. Therefore, changes to the previous day are given priority. Reporting data from other
      surveillance systems will become more visible. In particular data on ICU capacities are of great
      importance in the current situation.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 705,687
  (+18,487) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI (Table
  1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 364,350 cases (52%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (11/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 56% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 74% were female and 26% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (406 of 412). By now, 271 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 16 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  99 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population and 36 districts have a 7-day
  incidence of > 25 – 50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in the context of celebrations
  with family and friends. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large
  increases in the affected districts. However, many small outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, and community facilities, kindergartens and
  schools, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to
  the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 4), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated

  the real COVID-19 events in Germany. Values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 5.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

    The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past few days the R-value has
    been fluctuating and is currently below 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-
    CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this
    means that there is still a high number of new cases every day.
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
    collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
    well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
    16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
    (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
    As of 11/11/2020, a total of 1,289 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,502
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,787 (76%) are occupied, and 6,715 (24%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table .

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
    reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
    in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
    To assess the SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
    clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
    ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory
    survey, via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2
    Surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via
    the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
    Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 45/2020, 25,010,416 laboratory tests
    have been recorded to date, 736,792 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
    Up to and including week 45, 253 laboratories have registered for the RKI test laboratory survey or in
    one of the other transmitting networks and transmit data upon reminder largely on a weekly basis. Since
    laboratories can register and correct the tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is

      possible that the ascertained numbers can increase retrospectively. It should be noted that the number
      of tests is not the same as the number of persons tested, as the data may include multiple tests of
