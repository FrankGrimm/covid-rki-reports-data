reports in German, information on vaccination data and from the intensive care registry, as well as other
regularly uploaded data. [Information sources at provided at the end of this report].
The following information is provided in this situation report: Overview on the epidemiological situation,
demographic distribution of cases, surveys on laboratory tests of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, and information
from additional RKI-based surveillance systems.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed through the following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.

  according to the German Data Protection Act.
  Figure 2 shows the total number of cases with or without COVID-19-relevant symptoms as well as the
  proportion of hospitalised and deceased cases. Since deaths occur on average 2-3 weeks after infection,
  additional reports of deaths are expected for the most recent three weeks. The data used for this figure can

  Information on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      The RKI assesses the number of PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 carried out in Germany on a weekly basis by
      merging data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as clinical and outpatient laboratories
      throughout Germany. These data are shared voluntarily with the RKI from the following sources: An
      internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), the laboratory-
      based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
      (ARS)), and the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
      Table 2 shows the number of tests, the proportion of positive tests, as well as the number of reporting
      laboratories since the start of testing in Germany. Since laboratories can register and correct the tests from
      previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can change
      retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of people tested,
      since the data may include multiple tests from the same individuals within a time period of a few weeks
      (Table 2). Complete data since the beginning of testing are available through the following link:
      http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German). The current testing criteria can be found through the
      following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI-based surveillance
 systems on acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a platform at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI)
     within the population in Germany. In week 22, 2021, the total ARI rate remained stable, but increased in
     children 0 to 14 years. The total ARI rate is similar to the low values seen during 2020. Further information
     can be found through the following link: https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel primary care network. In week 22,
     2021, the total number of patient visits (consultations) due to ARI (ARI consultation rate) remained stable.
     Through virological surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 62 of 97 sentinel samples
     (64%) in week 22, 2021. Among those, human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) was found in 29 (30%) samples,
     rhinovirus in 27 (28%) samples and Parainfluenzavirus in eight (8%) samples. SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus
     were detected in none of the 97 sentinel samples in week 22, 2021. Further national and regional
     information can be found through the following links: https://influenza.rki.de/ and
     https://influenza.rki.de/Diagrams.aspx?agiRegion=0.
     A third ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in newly hospitalised
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses of influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). The total number of SARI cases decreased further in week 21, 2021. Of all
     reported SARI cases in week 21, 2021, 38% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4).
     Please note that due to data availability, only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis
     and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.
     Note: This report is a current snapshot and is updated on a weekly base.

      Figure 4: Weekly number of newly hospitalised SARI cases (ICD-10 codes J09-J22) and proportion of cases with a diagnosis of COVID-
      19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) among SARI cases with duration of hospitalisation of up to one week and with date of admission in weeks
      12, 2020 to 21, 2021. Data are derived from 72 sentinel hospitals.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of the, despite the recent decrease in case numbers, high case numbers of COVID-19 and the
      concerning dynamic of the SARS-CoV-2 variant distribution, the RKI assesses the threat to the health of the
      general population in Germany to be high. It highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2
      as well as the occurrence of many outbreaks, particularly in households, day-care facilities for children and
      increasingly in schools, as well as in occupational settings.
      In light of the increase in variants of concern (VOC), which have higher infectiousness, a rigorous reduction
      of physical contacts, use of protective measures, as well as intensive efforts to contain outbreaks and chains
      of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect people who are
      vulnerable.
      On 01/06/2021, the risk assessment was updated. The current version can be found through the following
      link: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

  Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date that cases are received by the RKI. Due to delays in
        data sharing, cases from previous days may be included in today’s numbers.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of shared cases minus deaths and the estimated number of
        recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimating recovered cases takes into account information on disease onset and
        hospitalisation, but does not do so for late effects since these data are not recorded regularly.
      4
        The number of persons vaccinated once includes all who received vaccines from BioNTech, Moderna,
        AstraZeneca or Janssen.
      5
        Vaccinated fully means: Vaccinated twice with vaccines from AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Moderna or one
        dose of the vaccine from Janssen or one dose of either vaccines for those who recovered from COVID-19.
