    The depiction of notified COVID-19 cases in Germany according to age groups and reporting week,
    shows a continuous and distinct relative decrease among the over 80 year olds since reporting week 17.
    In comparison, the proportion of cases in the younger age groups between 0-29 years of age is
    increasing (Figure 4).

    Figure 4: Percent of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=193,725 cases with respective data in the
    weeks 10 to 26 (30/06/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 166,073 (86%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (41%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,029 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,320 of 22,833 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,242 (17%) of 169,019 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 179,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 8,973 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 4,961 (55%) are men and 4,007 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,689 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    IfSG: Protection Against Infection Law
    So far, 13,834 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been notified among staff working in medical
    facilities as defined by Section 23 IfSG. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73%
    were female and 27% male. The median age was 41 years, 20 persons died.
    The low number of cases among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or
    education (Section 33 IfSG) reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The high number of
    cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with
    numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in three districts,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia), the citiy of Delmenhorst and the district of
    Oldenburg (both in Lower Saxony).
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to this outbreak, as employees of the meat
    processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive
    for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are in
    quarantine together with their household members. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the
    district of Guetersloh were closed on 18/06/2020 until the end of the summer holidays (11/08/2020), in
    the neighboring district of Warendorf since 25/06/2020. On 23/06/2020, the state of North Rhine-
    Westphalia officially implemented the second stage of a lockdown for the districts of Guetersloh and
    Warendorf until 30/06/2020. Widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented in the affected

      region. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in the food retail sector, kiosk staff and residents of
      central shared accommodations are being tested in Gütersloh and Warendorf. Any resident can have a
      test performed free of charge.
      Currently, two further outbreaks in other meat processing plants are ongoing in the district of Wesel in
      Nort Rhine-Westphalia and the district of Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. Both plants were temporarily
      closed. The high 7-day incidence in Delmenhorst is related to the outbreak in Oldenburg, as COVID-19
      infected workers live in the neighbouring district.
      A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals as well as refugee
      facilities.
      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 5 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

      Figure 5: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 30/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 26/06/2020).
      The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
      cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
      ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
      individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
      cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.83 (95%-prediction interval: 0.68 – 0.97)
      and is based on electronically notified cases as of 30/06/2020, 12:00 AM.

       Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
       compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
       of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.67 (95% prediction
       interval: 0.61 – 0.74) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 30/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
       After a temporary marked increase in the estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value),
       they have again decreased to a value of 1 or below over the past few days. The marked increase over
       the preceding days was related to increased case numbers mainly due to local, outbreak-related COVID-
       19 transmission with the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia playing a particularly important role (see
       section “Outbreaks”, above). The outbreak dynamics are also influenced in part by serial tests
       performed among possibly exposed persons, which led to the rapid detection of large numbers of
       additional COVID-19 cases in some of the outbreak settings. Since the case numbers in Germany are at a
       low level overall, local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction
       number. For this reason, the reproduction numbers may continue to fluctuate markedly.
       Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
       R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
       also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).

   DIVI intensive care register
       A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
       RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
       number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
       hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       As of 30/06/2020, a total of 1,275 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,502
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,997 (65%) are occupied, and 11,505 beds (35%) are
       currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
       differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
       discharged patients and deaths on some days compared to the previous day.

   Risk Assessment by the RKI
        General assessment
        At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
        number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
        of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
        at short notice based on new insights.
        Infection risk
        The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
        behaviour.
        Disease severity
        In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
        increasing age and underlying illnesses.
        Burden on health system
        The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
        capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
        burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
