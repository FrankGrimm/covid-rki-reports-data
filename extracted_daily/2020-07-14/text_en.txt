    Table 2 shows the mean age, gender distribution, percentage of hospitalized cases and deaths among
    cases reported in calendar weeks 10 to 28. The percentage of deaths in weeks 26 and 27 are not yet
    meaningful, as the outcome is not yet known for all cases.
    The depiction of notified COVID-19 cases in Germany according to age groups and reporting week,
    shows a continuous and distinct relative decrease among the over 80 year olds from reporting week 17
    to reporting week 24, accompanied by a decrease in absolute case numbers that persited in the ensuing
    weeks. The proportion of cases in the younger age groups up to 29 years of age increased from week 17
    to week 24 (Figure 4), with only small fluctuations since then. Absolute case numbers in children and
    adolescents under 20 years of age increased up to week 15, after which the continuously decreased
    until week 21. After plateauing until week 24, they increased markedly in almost all age groups in week
    25, only to decrease again in the two following weeks. The increase of cases in week 25 is related to a
    major outbreak in a meat processing plant. This particularly affected persons are in the 30-49 age group
    (see Figure 4).

    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 170,228 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
    cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,129 cases (3.0%). Since
    calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
    ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
    reported in 3,987 of 26,749 cases (15%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 29,778 (17%) of 173,872 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation status.
    Approximately 185,500 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 9,068 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    Of these, 5,010 (55%) are men and 4,051 (45%) are women (see Table 3), the gender was unknown in
    five cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,760 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
    older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
    under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
    all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
    The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in medical and other
    care facilites according to §23 and §36 IfSG (Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among
    persons cared for in these facilities. Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were
    female and 27% male. Their median age was 41 years.
    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
    among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
    reflects the low incidence in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases among
    persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with exactly or more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in two
    districts: the districts of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia) and Bad Toelz-Wolfrathshausen (Bavaria).
    In the district of Bad Toelz-Wolfrathshausen a higher incidence of of cases was observed in two refugee
    facilities. Appropriate containment measures were promptly implemented.
    The high but slowly decreasing 7-day incidence in this district is due to an outbreak in a meat processing
    plant. More than 1,500 employees were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The first employees were
    discharged from quarantine 14 days after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 hours after
    resolution of symptoms.
    A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities as
    well as religious communities.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
      The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
      since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
      transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
      temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 54 shows the result of this
      analysis.
      The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
      R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
      the notification system.

      Figure 5: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
      cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
      electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 14/07/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 10/07/2020).
      A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
      estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
      This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
      outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
      affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
      relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the case in
      Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
      The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.06 (95%-prediction interval: 0.81 – 1.26) and is based on
      electronically notified cases as of 14/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
      compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
      of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.91 (95% prediction
      interval: 0.79 – 1.03) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 14/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
      Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
      under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
      R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
      also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
      A detailed description of the methodology is available at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from

  DIVI intensive care register
       A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
       RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
       well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
       (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
       number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
       hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
       As of 14/07/2020, a total of 1,268 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 32,361
       intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,009 (63%) are occupied, and 11,352 beds (37%) are
       currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 5.

       *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the slightly changing number of reporting hospitals (with large
       differences in their number of beds) from day to day. This can explain the observed decrease in the cumulative number of
       discharged
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid of March. Currently, many districts are
       transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
       German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
       short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
