COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

  Summary (as of 06/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level, a further increase in reported COVID-19 cases
     is currently evident in the population of Germany. It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to
     commit itself to infection prevention and control.
  • After week 36 the portion of older age groups has increased again
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 17.8 cases per 100,000 population. The 7-day incidence
     exceeded 50 cases/100,000 population in 7 districts: the city of Hamm, the city of Remscheid, the district of
     Vechta and in the city of Berlin the following districts: Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Mitte, Neukoelln and
     Tempelhof-Schoeneberg. In a further 51 districts, it exceeded 25 cases/100,000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia and
     Hesse moderately higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • In total, 303,258 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,546 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
     electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case clusters are
     being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes and hospitals, facilities
     for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, various occupational settings, and among travellers,
     while the overall percentage of cases with an exposure outside of Germany has fallen below 10%.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 06/10/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. The R-value has been predominantly slightly
      greater than 1 since the beginning of September.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can only be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 303,258
  (+2,639) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
  the RKI (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 114,943 cases (38%), thus their date of reporting is provided.

  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (06/10/2020, 12:00 AM).

  The illustration of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany according to the proportion of cases per age
  group and reporting week in Figure 2 shows a high proportion of cases in the age groups 20 - 59 years at
  the beginning of the pandemic in reporting weeks 11 to 14. From reporting week 15 onwards, the
  proportion among persons aged 80 and over increased sharply, but then decreased again continuously
  from reporting week 17 to reporting week 25, accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of
  cases. This development continued in the following weeks. By comparison, the proportion of cases in the
  younger age groups between 0 and 29 years of age increased in the same period, but with a concurrent
  decrease in the number of cases. After reporting week 24, the proportions across all age groups entered
  a plateau phase with only slight fluctuations. Absolute case numbers increased from week 29. Since
  reporting week 36, however, case numbers have increased again, with a slight increase in the proportion
  of cases among older age groups.
  Figure 3: Presentation of the notified COVID-19 cases/ 100,000 inhabitants in Germany by age group and reporting week
  (06/10/2020, 12 AM)
  Figure 3 shows that at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, COVID-19 incidence increased initially
  among 15-34 year olds and 35-59 year olds, followed by older persons over 80 years of age. After the
  decline in incidence for all age groups, the highest incidence since the renewed increase in case numbers
  is currently seen in the age group of 15 to 34-year-olds, followed by the age group of 5 to 14-year-olds
  and now also the 35-59-year-olds. The incidence increased among persons 60 years of age and older
  from week 36.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 245,013 (81%) of the notified cases. Among these, cough
  (43%), fever (36%), rhinorrhoea (21%) and sore throat (20%) were reported most and 14% had no or no
  relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Pneumonia was reported in 5,849 cases (2.4%). Since calendar week 17,
  cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and
  anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was reported in 16,733
  of 100,412 cases (17%).

  Approximately 265,600 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.

  Table 2 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The proportion of
  deaths among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it decreased
  markedly until week 34 and has remained well under 1% since then. The proportion of cases reported
  with no or no symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until week 21 at 26%, and fluctuated
  thereafter only slightly until week 31. Following, the proportion increased to 35% in week 34, but

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to day of death are shown by calendar week in Figure 4.
  Of all deaths, 8,137 (85%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 14% of all cases were in this
  age group (Table 3). Thus far, two deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been
  reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for both of them. The number of
  deaths may change after data validation is completed.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 27% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 4).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.

  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
  place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of
  reporting week 25, borders reopened, initially in Europe, after which the proportion of cases reporting a
  probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined
  again since, to currently 7.7% (Figure 5). In weeks 37-40, 6,203 persons reported a possible site of
  infection abroad.
  Table 5 lists the top 16 countries in addition to Germany most frequently reported as the probable place

  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad increased significantly after the
  opening of borders in calendar week 25, but has been declining again since week 35 (see Figure 5).
  Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be
  greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and hygiene and
  avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
  immediately. In addition, travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
  maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported from 58 districts,
  including the city of Hamm, the city of Remscheid, the districts district of Vechta and in the city of Berlin
  the districts of Berlin Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Berlin Mitte, Berlin Neukoelln and Berlin Tempelhof-
  Schoeneberg, with 7-day incidences of >50 cases/100,000 population.
  The increased incidence in the city of Hamm is largely due to about 200 cases in connection with a
  wedding. More than 300 identified guests were tested and are under quarantine. Stricter distancing
  measures have been implemented in Hamm.
  The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin (Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Mitte, Neukoelln, Tempelhof-
  Schoeneberg) is due to more diffuse transmission, including spread among young and international

     travellers and party guests, who contracted the infection during travel or at parties and subsequently
     infected household members and family.
     In the district of Vechta, an outbreak occurred in a long-term care facility with a total of 50 cases among
     staff and residents. The outbreak has currently infected 100 people in the district with the corona virus.
     In the city of Remscheid the high incidence is primarily due to smaller outbreaks in day care centres and
     schools with spread to outside contacts. Stricter control measures have been implemented.
     Currently, COVID-19 cases are predominantly due to transmission at family and other private events. The
     proportion of travel returnees among the cases is decreasing. The number of COVID-19-related
     outbreaks reported in nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community
     facilities, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events has increased.
     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 06/10/2020, a total of 1,283 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,345
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,490 (71%) are occupied, and 8,855 (28%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and
     therefore the number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain
     an occasionally important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or
     deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
