  Summary (as of 10/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
     strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 139.1 cases per 100,000 population.
  • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
     incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 94.2 cases/100.000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony is higher than the national total
     7-day incidence.
  • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 6 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
     today, 31 districts have an incidence of >25-50 cases /100,000 population, 107 districts have an incidence of >50-100
     cases/100,000 population, 268 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 15 districts have
     an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
  • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private
     gatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as
     in occupational settings or related to religious events.
  • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has almost tripled in the past 2 weeks from 1,470 patients on
     27/10/2020 to 3,059 patients on 10/11/2020.
  • In total, 687,299 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11,506 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted
     to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 10/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating around
      1. This means that each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 will infect on average one other person. As the
      number of infected persons is currently high in Germany, this means that the daily number of newly
      infected persons will remain high.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational settings, and in
      old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts there is an increasingly diffuse spread of
      SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 687,200
  (+15,332) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 353,866 cases (51%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  the weeks 10 to 45 (10/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 2). Age-specific case numbers and
  age-specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung.
  The first wave of the pandemic in Germany started in week 11 with a high 7-day incidence in 20-59-year-
  olds followed by a rising incidence in the over-80 years old until week 15, which fell again until week 24.
  Since reporting week 32, the nationwide 7-day incidence has increased steadily starting in younger age-
  groups, and since reporting week 41 also in older age groups.
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 445,747 (65%) of the notified cases, of these 15% had no or no
  relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Table 2 shows the number and percentage of the COVID-19 relevant or
  most common symptoms.

  Table 3 shows the distribution of hospitalizations and deaths by reporting week. The proportion of deaths
  among all notified cases peaked at 7% in reporting week 16, 2020. Since then, it decreased markedly until
  week 34 and has remained well under 1% since then. The proportion of cases reported with no or no
  symptoms relevant for COVID-19 increased over time until week 34 to 35%, but decreased since then to
  below 20% after week 38.

  Notified COVID-19 deaths according to week of death are shown in Figure 3. The number of deaths has
  been increasing since week 37; markedly since week 42.
  Of all deaths, 9,860 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or older, but only 12% of all cases were in this age
  group (Table 4). Thus far, 6 deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to
  the RKI, three of these have been confirmed. Validation of the other three is in progress. Pre-existing
  medical conditions were reported for two of the six cases. The number of deaths may change upon
  completion of data validation.

  Possible countries of exposure
  Of the 687,200 reported COVID-19 cases, information regarding the country of exposure was missing in
  301,541 (44%) cases.
  In reporting week 11, the proportion of all cases was 46% for cases that had a possible foreign country as
  place of exposure. It then fell steadily to 0.4% in reporting week 19 as a result of travel restrictions. As of

  probable country of infection abroad markedly increased. It peaked in week 34 at 49% and declined
  again since then. While the absolute figures for cases with foreign exposure since week 38 are at an
  average of 1586 cases per week [range 1256 - 2088], the proportion has clearly decreased to 1.0% in
  week 45. This is due to the high number of autochthonous cases, which is >100,000 cases in the last 7
  days. In weeks 42-45, 6.870 persons reported a possible site of infection abroad.
  Table 5 lists the countries in addition to Germany that were most frequently reported as the probable
  place of infection in weeks 42 to 45. Poland, Romania, Italy, Turkey, and Austria were most frequently
  reported as the country of exposure.

  The proportion of cases with a probable place of infection abroad increased significantly after the
  opening of borders in calendar week 25, but has been declining again since week 35 (see Figure 5).
  Through consistent prevention and early case identification, transmission and subsequent cases can be
  greatly reduced. It remains essential that people follow the rules of physical distancing and hygiene and
  avoid crowds, and that anyone who develops symptoms compatible with COVID-19 be tested
  immediately. In addition, travelers who stayed in a COVID-19 risk area within 14 days of entry must
  maintain a 14-day quarantine unless they have a negative test result (see
  https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus-infos-reisende/).
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (405 of 412). By now, 266 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 15 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  97 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population and 42 districts have a 7-day
  incidence of > 25 – 50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in the context of celebrations
  with family and friends. On some occasions, specific large outbreaks have been the cause for large
  increases in the affected districts. However, many small outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in
  hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, and community facilities, kindergartens and

    schools, various occupational settings and in the context of religious gatherings continue to contribute to
    the increase of incidence.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 4), a statistical procedure that
    shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
    the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
    given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
    the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
    the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
    the real COVID-19 events in Germany. Values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
    The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 5.
                                        4-day R-value                                                 7-day R-value
                                             0.88                                                          0.92
                             (95%-prediction interval: (0.73 – 1.05)                       (95%-prediction interval: 0.84 – 1.00)
    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
    less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

        Figure 5: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
        COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 10/11/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 06/11/2020).
        The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past few days the R-value has
        been fluctuating around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects
        another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that
        there is still a high number of new cases every day.
        Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
        under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
        https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from

     DIVI intensive care register
        The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
        collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
        well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
        16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
        (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
        As of 09/11/2020, a total of 1,288 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,494
        intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,577 (76%) are occupied, and 6,917 (24%) are currently
        available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 6.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of the recent further increase in case numbers, the risk assessment of the RKI was adapted to the
     epidemiologic situation on 26/10/2020. The current version can be found here:
