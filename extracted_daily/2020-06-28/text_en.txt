COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the
German Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state
health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data
on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 28/06/2020 12:00 AM)
        •     The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A
              total of 145 districts transmitted zero cases.
        •     In total, 193,499 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 8,957 deaths due to COVID-19 have
              been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •     COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported sporadically in nursing homes and hospitals as well as
              refugee facilities.
        •     Outbreaks of COVID-19 in meat processing plants have been reported in several federal states. In
              the district of Guetersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, such an outbreak led to a high 7-day
              incidence of over 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

    Distribution of cases over time
    The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
    transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01.03.2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
    of symptoms is unknown in 57,489 cases (30%); for these, the date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

    alternatively by date of reporting from 01/03/2020 (28/06/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Clinical aspects
    Approximately 177,700 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
    recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
    In total, 8,957 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.6% of all confirmed cases).
    So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-
    existing medical conditions were reported for all three.

    Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
    In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
    accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
    Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
    the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
    considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
    the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in one district,
    the district of Guetersloh (North Rhine-Westphalia).
    The high 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant.
    Increased case numbers in neighboring districts are linked to the outbreak in Guetersloh as employees
    of the meat processing company are residents of these districts. More than 1,500 employees were
    tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all
    employees are in quarantine together with their household members. In addition, all schools and day-
    care centres in the district of Guetersloh were closed on 18/06/2020 until the end of the summer
    holidays (11/08/2020), in the neighboring district of Warendorf since 25/06/2020. On 23/06/2020, the
    state of North Rhine-Westphalia officially implemented the second stage of a lockdown for the districts
    of Guetersloh and Warendorf until 30/06/2020. Widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been
    implemented in the affected region. Nursing facilities, hospitals, employees in the food retail sector,
    kiosk staff and residents of central shared accommodations are being tested in Gütersloh and
    Warendorf. Any resident can have a test performed free of charge.
    Currently, two further outbreaks in other meat processing plants are ongoing in the district of Wesel in
    Northrhine-Westphalia and the district of Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. Both plants were temporarily
    closed.
    A few COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals as well as refugee
    facilities.

    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 2 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.
    Figure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 28/06/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 24/06/2020).
    The sensitive R-value reported can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new
    cases estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks
    ago. This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by
    individual outbreaks. This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new
    cases is small. The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.71 (95%-prediction interval: 0.59 – 0.84)
    and is based on electronically notified cases as of 28/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 0.71 (95% prediction
    interval: 0.65 – 0.77 and is based on electronically notified cases as of 28/06/2020, 12:00 AM.
    After a temporary marked increase in the estimated reproduction numbers (R-value and 7-day R-value),
    they have again decreased to a value of 1 or below over the past few days. The marked increase over
    the preceding days was related to increased case numbers mainly due to local, outbreak-related
    increased COVID-19 transmission (see section “Outbreaks”, above), with the outbreak in North Rhine-
    Westphalia playing a particularly important role. The outbreak dynamics are also influenced in part by
    serial tests performed among possibly exposed persons, which led to the rapid detection of large
    numbers of additional COVID-19 cases in some of the outbreak settings. Since the case numbers in

       Germany are at a low level overall, local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the
       reproduction number. For this reason, the reproduction numbers may continue to fluctuate markedly.
       Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
       under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day
       R-value is also available there. More general information and sample calculations for both R-values can
       also be found in our FAQs (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-faq).
       A detailed description of the methodology is available at

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
       General assessment
       At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
       number of newly reported cases is currently decreasing. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health
       of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change
       at short notice based on new insights.
       Infection risk
       The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
       behaviour.
       Disease severity
       In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
       increasing age and underlying illnesses.
       Burden on health system
       The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
       capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
       burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
