  The difference to previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay of data transmission former cases may be included.

  Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

    Summary (as of 20/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
        strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 139 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 107 cases/100,000 population.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony is higher than the national total
        7-day incidence.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 5 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000 population. In
        comparison, 267 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 18 districts have an incidence
        of >250 cases/100,000 population.
    • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households,
        but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to
        religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
    • Since mid of October, the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has strongly increased, from 655 patients
        on October 15th to 3,615 patients on 20/11/2020.
    • On 20/11/2020, 23,648 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 260 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
        been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

      COVID-19 Situation Report 20/11/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating and is
      currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still
      a high number of new cases every day.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including households and in old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts
      there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 879,564
  (+23,648) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e,g, detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020, Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 466,328 cases (53%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (20/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in many cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is
  consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  As of 18/11/2020, the number and proportion of persons ≥ 60 years old are reported in each category of
  Table 2.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (407 of 412). There are 18 districts in the group of the highest incidence of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in
  the last 7 days. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many small
  outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  and community facilities, kindergartens and schools, various occupational settings and in the context of
  religious gatherings continue to contribute to the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person,
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days, This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value, After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards, In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards, They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable,
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3,
                          4-day R-value                                                               7-day R-value
                                 0.98                                                                       1.05
          (95%-prediction interval: 0.79 – 1.19)                                      (95%- Prädiktionsintervall: 0.95 – 1.18)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value, The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value,

  cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset

  Figure 3: The estimated R-values (in green and orange) over the last 60 days, against the background of estimated number of
  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 20/11/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 16/11/2020).
  The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past few days the R-value has
  been fluctuating and is currently around 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-
  CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this
  means that there is still a high number of new cases every day.
  Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
  under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
  https://ww.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull, 17 | 2020 from

 DIVI intensive care register
    The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
    collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
    well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
    16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
    (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
    As of 20/11/2020, a total of 1,287 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,173
    intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,066 (78%) are occupied, and 6,107 (22%) are currently
    available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

    *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
    reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
    in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Mortality Monitoring
    A total of 26 European countries provide the European EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of
    excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis which allows
    the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and pandemics
    (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of data
    have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
    monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
    An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
    April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also among
    those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
    Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. After a return to expected levels for most countries in May (with
    the exception of a heat-related peak in August), total all-cause mortality in the reporting countries has
    again increased above expected levels since calendar week 38. This is primarily due to increased
    mortality in Belgium, England, Italy, Portugal Spain and Switzerland. The excess all-cause mortality is
    seen primarily in the age group of 65 years and above, but also in the age groups of 15-44 and 45-64
    years.
    Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with a
    certain time lag. A special evaluation of excess mortality is normally updated weekly every two weeks.
    Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

      Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in the number
      of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
      significantly above the average of previous years; but decreased to expected levels since the beginning
      of May, with the exception of a heat-related increase in August. In September, however, deaths again
      increased to 5% above the expected number based on the mean number of deaths observed from 2016
      to 2019. In calendar week 43, 2020 (19/10 – 25/10/2020), 18,011 persons died (+621 compared to week
      41).
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
