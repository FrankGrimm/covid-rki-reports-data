  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1), age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed at: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung .
  Figure 1: 7-day-incidence of notified COVID-19 cases by age group and reporting week (n=3,014,986 cases with respective data in
  the weeks 16 to 53, 2020, and weeks 01-14, 2021 (as of 13/04/2021, 12:00 AM). Data from the mandatory surveillance system
  according to the German Data Protection Act.
  Figure 2 displays the total number of cases with or without COVID-19 relevant symptoms as well as
  proportion of hospitalized and deceased. As deaths occur on average 2-3 weeks after infection, further
  reports of deaths are expected for the most recent three weeks. The data on which the figure is based can
  be found at: www.rki.de/covid-19-tabelle-klinische-aspekte .

  Surveys on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
     To assess the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test numbers, data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as
     clinical and outpatient laboratories throughout Germany are merged weekly at the RKI. These data are
     ascertained on a voluntary basis and are transmitted to RKI via an internet-based RKI test laboratory survey,
     via the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), via the laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance
     established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (ARS)) and via the enquiry of a
     professional association of laboratory medicine.
     The number of tests, the proportion of positive tests as well as the number of reporting laboratories since
     the beginning of testing in Germany are shown in table 2. Since laboratories can register and correct the
     tests of the previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can change
     retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of persons
     tested as the data may include multiple tests of individual patients (Table 2) with data for the last weeks –
     complete data since beginning of testing are available at (in German). The current testing criteria can be
     found under: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI),
     utilizing information from the population. In week 14, 2021, the ARI rate remained stable in total. The ARI
     rate decreased in the age group 0 to 14 years, but increased in all other age groups, especially in the age
     group 35 to 60 years. Since week 36, 2020, the total ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years,
     but now approaches the values of season 2019/20. Further information can be found under
     https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network on primary care level. In week
     14, 2021, the overall number of patient visits (consultations) due to ARI (ARI consultation rate) remained
     stable. The ARI consultation rate decreased for age groups below 15 years, but increased in age groups 15
     years and above. The ARI consultation rate remained on a lower level compared to previous years. Within
     the virological surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 56 of 139 sentinel samples (40%)
     in week 14, 2021. Among those, human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) was identified in 20 (14%), rhinovirus
     in 17 (12%) and SARS-CoV-2 in 16 (12%). Parainfluenzavirus and Metapneumonvirus were found in two
     samples each (2%). Further information - both on national and regional level - can be found under
     https://influenza.rki.de/ and under https://influenza.rki.de/Diagrams.aspx?agiRegion=0.
     A third, ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized patients
     (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of the lower
     respiratory tract). The number of SARI cases remained stable in week 13, 2021. The number of SARI cases
     increased in the age groups below 35 years, especially for the age group 0 to 4 years. In the age groups 60
     years and above, the number decreased slightly. The number of SARI cases in age group 35 to 59 years
     remained on a very high level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 13, 2021, 60% were diagnosed with
     COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an
     ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in
     this analysis.

      U07,1!) among SARI cases with duration of hospitalization of up to one week and with date of admission in weeks 12, 2020 to 13,
      2021, from 71 sentinel hospitals.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers and the current accelerated resurgence of the 7-day incidence,
      the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general population to be very high, it highlights
      the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of many outbreaks especially
      in households, day-care facilities for children and increasingly in schools as well as and occupational
      settings.
      Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
      rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
      outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
      vulnerable persons.
      On 31/03/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
      current version can be found here: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

  Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
        transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
        number of recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
        hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
