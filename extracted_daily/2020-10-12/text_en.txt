 COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
  – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
  Summary (as of 12/10/2020, 12:00 AM)
  • Currently, an accelerated increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed.
     Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and
     control.
  • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days increased to 27.5 cases per 100,000 population.
  • The 7-day incidence in Berlin and Bremen is considerably higher, in North Rhine-Westphalia and
     Hesse slightly higher than the national mean 7-day incidence.
  • The districts Neukoelln and Mitte in Berlin exceeded a 7-day incidence of 100 cases/100,000
     population. The 7-day incidence was 50 to 100 cases/100,000 population in 30 districts, in 103
     additional districts it exceeded 25 cases/100,000 population.
  • Since beginning of September the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again.
  • A large number of COVID-19-related outbreaks continue to be reported in various settings. Case
     clusters are being reported particularly in the context of religious or family events, in nursing homes
     and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, community facilities, meat-processing
     plants, various occupational settings, and among travellers.
  • In total, 325,331 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,621 deaths associated with COVID-19
     have been electronically transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 12/10/2020
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      further increase is currently observed in the population in some federal states. The proportion of COVID-
      19 cases in the older age groups is currently slightly increasing, while the proportion of cases among
      travel returnees is decreasing since calendar week 34. Since the end of September, an increase of the R-
      values, which are above one, can be observed.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including large celebrations in the family and circle of friends, in occupational and religious
      settings, or, especially, in cases among younger people, outbreaks originating from travel returnees. The
      current development must be further carefully monitored.
      Since calendar week 30, the proportion of deaths among COVID-19 cases has been consistently below
      1% and is thus markedly lower than among cases in the spring, particularly in April. It is unlikely that the
      virus has changed to become less pathogenic. Rather, the low proportion of deaths can be explained as
      follows: On the one hand, recent infections have occurred mainly among young people, who rarely
      experience a severe course of disease. On the other hand there is also broader testing, which means
      more milder cases are identified. Additionally, as the number of cases increases, the true proportion of
      severe courses of disease and deaths only becomes apparent sometime after diagnosis. If the trend
      continues and elderly and vulnerable people are increasingly infected with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in
      hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected. Severe cases and deaths can mainly be prevented through
      decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided if possible and celebrations should be limited to the closest circle
      of family and friends.

  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 127,178 cases (39%), thus their date of reporting is provided.
  Fi gure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – i f
  unknown – a lternatively by date of reporting s ince 01/03/2020 (12/10/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 29% of cases; the numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG and among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG (Table 2).
  The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 73% were female and 27% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for 135 districts,
  including 2 city districts in Berlin (Neukoelln, Mitte) with an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population and 30 districts with a 7-day incidences of >50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard
  (https://corona.rki.de/) shows all affected districts
  Currently, in most districts it is mostly a diffuse situation with increased frequency of COVID-10 cases in
  connection with private celebrations with family and friends. In several affected districts larger
  outbreaks are the cause of the sharp increase in case numbers. However, many smaller outbreaks in
  nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for asylum seekers and refugees, community facilities, schools and
  kindergarten, various occupational settings and in connection with religious events, continue to
  contribute to the increase in incidence.
  The increased incidence in the districts of Berlin is due to more diffuse transmission. Stricter distancing
  rules and opening restrictions for restaurants, bars and shops are applied since 10/10/2020.
  Among the 32 districts with more than 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants, the increase in incidence in the
  following districts can be attributed mainly to a single outbreak:
  In the district of Cloppenburg 89 cases are related to an outbreak among workers of a slaughterhouse.
  In the district of Esslingen, a cargo centre has developed as a hotspot for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
  addition to a diffuse situation of infection.
  In the city Hamm, more than 200 corona infections are associated with a wedding.
  In the Wesermarsch district, the increase in incidence is directly related to the incidence of infections at
  the childcare facilities and schools in Lemwerder.

     Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
     The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
     R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting (Figure 2) and not directly
     extracted from the notification system.
                           4-day R-value                                                        7-day R-value
                                 1.29                                                                 1.25
           (95%-prediction interval: 1.01 – 1.56)                                (95%-prediction interval: 1.10 – 1.40)
     Fi gure 2: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of i llness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
     ca s es without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified ca ses a ccording to i llness onset
     el ectronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 12/10/2020, 12 AM, ta ki ng into account cases up to 07/10/2020).
     The reported R values have been predominantly higher than 1 since the beginning of September. Since
     the end of September, an increase of the R-values can be observed.
     Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
     under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
     https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art_02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
     23/04/2020).
  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister)
     As of 12/10/2020, a total of 1,278 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 30,242
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 20,906 (69%) are occupied, and 9,336 (31%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3. The

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the
     number of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally
     important decrease or increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day
     before.
