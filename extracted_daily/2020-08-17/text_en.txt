COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
        – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
        Summary (as of 17/08/2020 12:00 AM)
        •    In the past few weeks the COVID-19 incidence has risen markedly in many federal states and the
             number of districts reporting zero COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days has decreased
             considerably. This trend is very concerning.
        •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 8.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
             and thus remains at an increased level. A total of only 25 districts transmitted zero cases over the
             past 7 days. In a further 180 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5.0/100,000 inhabitants.
        •    In North-Rhine Westphalia, Berlin and Hesse the 7-day incidences are markedly and in Hamburg
             just above the national mean 7-day-incidence.
        •    In total, 224,014 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,232 deaths associated with COVID-19
             have been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.
        •    Moreover, further COVID-19-related outbreaks are being reported in various settings, including
             nursing homes and hospitals, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, meat-processing plants,
             agricultural and other occupational settings, educational settings and especially among travellers
             and in the context of religious events or events with family and friends.

     COVID-19 Situation Report 17/08/2020

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      General current assessment
      The increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases over the past weeks can be observed in many of
      the federal states. The daily number of Covid-19 cases transmitted to the RKI has declined slightly in the
      past two days due to lower testing and reporting activity over the weekend.
      Nationwide, there are reports of many smaller outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in
      various settings, such as larger family events, leisure activities, educational and occupational settings,
      but also in community and health facilities. In addition, COVID-19 cases are increasingly being identified
      among travellers entering Germany. The variety and number of transmission settings has led to a
      substantial increase in the number of cases.
      The number of new cases reported daily has been increasing since calender week 30. This development
      is increasing in dynamic and is very concerning. A further worsening of the situation must be avoided.
      This will only succeed if the entire population continues to be committed to decreasing transmission,
      e.g. by consistently observing rules of physical distancing and hygiene - also in outdoor settings -, by
      airing indoor areas and, where indicated, wearing a community or face mask correctly as well as by
      avoiding mass gatherings – especially in indoor areas – and limiting close contacts to immediate family
      and friends.
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 224,014
      (+561) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been electronically reported to and validated by
      the RKI (see
      Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 25 districts reported no cases in the past 7 days. In the past few weeks,
      the number of districts not transmitting any COVID-19 cases over a period of 7 days decreased
      continuously, from a maximum of 125 districts on 12/07/2020.
      Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  *Saarland and Saxony-Anhalt did not submit any data yesterday.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the
  onset of symptoms is unknown in 73,317 cases (33%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure
  2.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  unknown- alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (17/08/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all notified cases, 51% are female and 49% are male. Among all notified cases for whom data on age
  and gender were reported, 7,322 were children under 10 years of age (3.3%), 13,265 children and
  teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5.9%), 101,545 persons aged 20 to 49 years (45%), 64,177 persons aged
  50 to 69 years (29%), 31,602 persons aged 70 to 89 years (14%) and 5,522 persons aged 90 years and
  older (2.5%). The age and/or gender was unknown in 581 notified cases. Cases had a mean age of 47
  years (median age 47 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older (Figure
  3).

  cases with information available (17/08/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 188,214 (84%) of the notified cases. Commonly reported
  symptoms were cough (46%), fever (39%), rhinorrhoea (21%) and sore throat (19%). Pneumonia was
  reported in 5,366 cases (3%). Since calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-
  19 surveillance category. Since then, ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least
  one of these two symptoms was reported in 6,572 of 43,929 cases (15%).
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Hospitalisation was reported for 31,575 (16%) of 194,321 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 202,100 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  A total of 9,232 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.1% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,115 (55%) are men and 4,113 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender is unknown in four
  cases.
  The median age of COVID-19 cases reported to have died was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,892 (85%) were
  in people aged 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Thus far, three deaths
  among COVID-19 cases under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical
  conditions were reported for all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases. Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is
  missing in 25% of cases, the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities
  reported here should be considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the
  above mentioned facilities, the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these
  facilities is unknown.

7                                                                                                                 7
  Table 3). The number of deaths was particularly high among persons cared for in these facilities.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities, 73% were female and 27% male. Their
  median age was 41 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care
  facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§42 IfSG) is largely due to outbreaks in
  meat processing plants.
  Outbreaks
  Six districts reported an increased incidence of ≥25 cases in 7 days/100.000 inhabitants: the district of
  Dingolfing-Landau in Bavaria, the cities of Herne, Hagen, Duisburg and Wuppertal in Northrhine
  Westphalia, the district of Berlin Mitte in Berlin and the city of Offenbach in Hesse.
  In the district of Dingolfing-Landau the incidence increased due to two outbreaks, the first in an
  agricultural company and the second – responsible for most of the currently active cases - in a canning
  company, with together close to 500 COVID-19-cases. The renewed increase to >100 Covid-19
  cases/100,000 inhabitants is due to further cases detected through retesting of exposed persons as well
  as new cases in the general population, including among returning travellers. No spread from the
  outbreaks to the general population has been detected thus far.
  In the cities of Herne, Hagen, Duisburg, Wuppertal, Berlin Mitte and Offenbach cases detected among
  travellers entering Germany as well as family clusters play an important role in the observed high 7-day
  incidence.
  Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
  educational settings, meat-processing plants and other occupational settings, in the context of family
  events and religious communities as well as among travellers.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
  since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
  transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
  temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
  analysis.
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
  the notification system.

    Figure 4: Number of notified COVID-19 cases with known date of illness onset (dark blue), estimated date of illness onset for
    cases without reported date of onset (grey) and estimated number of not yet notified cases according to illness onset
    electronically reported to RKI (light blue) (as of 17/08/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 13/08/2020).
    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to
    relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if the total number of new cases is small.
    The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 1.11 (95%-prediction interval: 0.90 – 1.35) and is based on
    electronically notified cases as of 17/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
    Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
    compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
    of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.04 (95% prediction
    interval: 0.93 – 1.16) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 17/08/2020, 12:00 AM.
    The reported R values has been around 1 or slightly above since mid-July 2020. This is associated with a
    larger number of outbreaks, but also with case numbers in Germany overall, which have increased
    steadily in recent weeks since the relaxation of the measures and due to an increased number of travel
    returnees.

  DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was established to document intensive care capacity as
      well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals
      (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister). The DIVI intensive care register documents the
      number of available intensive care beds in the reporting hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all
      hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report.
      As of 17/08/2020, a total of 1,281 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall,
      30,320 intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,078 (70%) are occupied, and 9,242 (30%) are
      currently available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 4.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number
      of reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or
      increase in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of cases continues to increase worldwide. The number of newly reported cases declined from
      mid-March until early July. Since then, case numbers have been steadily increasing. Some districts are
      transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. However, individual outbreaks are increasingly occurring
      again, which can reach considerable proportions. Vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics are currently not
      available. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and
      as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at short notice based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily from person to person. The risk of infection depends heavily on
      the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual behaviour (physical distancing, hygiene
      measures and community masks).
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. Individual long-term consequences cannot be estimated yet.

     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends largely on the geographical distribution of cases, health
     care capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). In
     large parts of Germany it is currently low, but it can rapidly increase locally and affect the public health
     system in particular as well as medical care facilities.
