       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
    3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
       data were not recorded regularly.

      Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, no updated figures are reported.
       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.

       Summary (as of 15/01/2021, 12:00 AM)
       • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general
           population as very high.
       • Yesterday, 22,368 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,113 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the
           RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 146 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is
           markedly above the national incidence.
       • All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 312 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
           45 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and two districts have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.
       • The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 113 and of people ≥80 years 299 cases/100,000 population.
       • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,
           occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.
       • On 15/01/2021, 5,074 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 1,607 existing patients had been discharged (16 % of
           whom had died) and 1,556 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 51 less than the prior day.
       • Since 26/12/2020 a total of 961,682 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (11.6 vaccinated per 1,000 population)
           (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).
       • Mortality Monitoring: Mortality is significantly increased compared to the 2016-2019 average.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 15/01/2021
2
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI considers all laboratory
  confirmations of SARS-CoV-2 and confirms these via nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) or direct pathogen
  detection, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19 cases. Thus, in the
  following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-
  19 disease.
  General current assessment
  Since the beginning of December, there has been a renewed sharp rise in the number of cases. During the
  holidays, the number of cases decreased. In the last few days, the number of cases has risen again. Whether
  this trend will continue, beyond the expected retesting and re-reporting, will only become clear in the
  course of the next few days.
  The R-value is currently around 1. Due to the very high number of infected persons in Germany, this means
  a high number of new infections per day.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is an
  increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often have more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number of
  serious cases and deaths remains on a high level. These can be avoided if all prevent the spread of the
  SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people - especially indoors -
  should be avoided.
  On 19/12/2020, a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) was reported in the UK. To date, it is unknown how the new
  virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases with the new variant have already been detected in
  numerous countries around the world. So far, a few cases of this new variant in Germany have been
  reported to the RKI. Further cases may be expected. WHO has also reported another new virus variant
  detected in South Africa possibly associated with higher transmissibility and more severe disease. Isolates
  of this lineage have also been identified sporadically in Germany.
  In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission
  to the RKI. In some cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case
  numbers compared to those reported by the RKI.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  * In Brandenburg, some health authorities experienced a backlog in data entry and thus in data transmission to the RKI. In some
  cases, this leads to large discrepancies between locally reported incidences and case numbers compared to those reported by the
  RKI.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,092,940 cases (55 %) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

    are 45 districts with incidences of >250 to 500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days and there were two districts
    with an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 in the last 7 days. The dashboard shows all affected districts
    (https://corona.rki.de).
    In most districts, the transmission is diffuse with many outbreaks particularly in retirement and nursing
    homes, occupational settings and private households. In some counties, a specific, larger outbreak is known
    to be the cause of the high incidence. Many smaller outbreaks continue to contribute to the elevated
    incidence, for example outbreaks in hospitals.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
    estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
    the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
    days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
    R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
    and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
    week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
    events in Germany, values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently estimated
    course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                                            4-day R-value                                                 7-day R-value
                                                 0.91                                                          0.99
                                 (95%-prediction interval: 0.78 – 1.04)                        (95%-prediction interval: 0.90 – 1.07)
    Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
    affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
     with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
     number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
     with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
     As of 15/01/2021, a total of 1,280 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,968
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 22,574 (84 %) are occupied, and 4,394 (16 %) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
     patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
     cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Mortality Monitoring
     A total of 27 European countries or regions provide the European EuroMOMO project (European
     monitoring of excess mortality for public health action) with official mortality statistics on a weekly basis
     which allows the detection and measuring of excess deaths related to e.g. seasonal influenza and
     pandemics (https://www.euromomo.eu/). In Germany, two regional systems that allow the transmission of
     data have been established so far (since 2007 in Berlin and Hesse). The establishment of a nationwide
     monitoring system is planned from 2021 onwards.
     An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in
     April 2020. Excess mortality was observed primarily in persons 65 years of age and older, but also among
     those 15 to 64-years of age. Excess mortality was highest in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain,
     Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. After a return to expected levels for most countries in May (with the
     exception of a heat-related peak in August), total all-cause mortality in the reporting countries has again
     increased above expected levels since calendar week 38. Mortality is particularly high in Austria, Belgium,
     France, Italy, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. The excess all-cause mortality is seen primarily in the age
     group of 45 years and above.
     Weekly mortality statistics are also recorded on the website of the Federal Statistical Office, albeit with a
     certain time lag. Looking at the development by months, in March 2020 there was no noticeable increase in
     the number of deaths compared to March of the previous year. In April, however, all-cause mortality was
     considerably higher than the average of previous years; since the beginning of May, mortality decreased to
     expected levels, with the exception of a heat-related increase in August. In September, however, deaths
     again increased to 5% above the expected number based on the mean number of deaths observed from
     2016 to 2019. In calendar week 51 (14/12 – 20/12/2020), 23,550 persons died (+256 compared to week 50).

 Risk Assessment by the RKI
     In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI now judges the threat to the health of the general
     population to be very high. The revised version highlights the increasingly diffuse SARS-CoV-2 transmission
     as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in households, occupational settings and nursing and
     senior care homes.
     Therefore, more rigorous case finding and contact tracing as well as better protection of vulnerable groups
     is essential. Vulnerable persons can only be reliably protected if the number of new infections can be
     reduced substantially. On 12/01/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-
     CoV-2 variants. The current version can be found here:
