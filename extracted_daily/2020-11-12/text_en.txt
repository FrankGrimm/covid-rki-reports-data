  The difference to previous day relates to data entry at RKI; due to delay of data transmission former cases may be included.
2 Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated number of recovered cases.
3 The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information about disease onset and hospitalization but not for late effects because such
  data were not recorded regularly.
  COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
  Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
  situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI.
    – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
    Summary (as of 12/11/2020, 12:00 AM)
    • Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is
        strongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
    • The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 139 cases per 100,000 population.
    • Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
        incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 95 cases/100.000 population.
    • The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and Saxony is higher than the
        national total 7-day incidence.
    • Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 5 districts have an incidence ≤25 cases/100,000 population. As of
        today, 35 districts have an incidence of >25-50 cases /100,000 population, 103 districts have an incidence of >50-100
        cases/100,000 population, 269 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 16 districts have
        an incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.
    • The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households, but also in
        community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to religious
        events.
    • The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has increased in the past 2 weeks from 1,696 patients on
        29/10/2020 to 3,186 patients on 12/11/2020.
    • On 12/11/2020, 21,866 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 215 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been
        transmitted to the RKI in Germany.

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², RKI considers all laboratory
      confirmations of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, as COVID-19
      cases. Thus, in the following report the term "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as
      well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
      General current assessment
      After a temporary stabilisation of case numbers at a higher level in late August and early September,
      there is currently an increase of transmission within the population in all federal states. The proportion
      of COVID-19 cases in older age groups is currently increasing. The reported R-values were stable well
      above 1 since the beginning of October. Over the past few days the R-value has been fluctuating and is
      currently below 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 infects another
      person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this means that there is still
      a high number of new cases every day.
      The data table on page 1 was adapted on November 11. The aim of the change is to focus on the current
      situation primarily. Therefore, changes to the previous day are given priority. Reporting data from other
      surveillance systems will become more visible. In particular data on ICU capacities are of great
      importance in the current situation.
      There are outbreaks in various districts throughout Germany, which are associated with different
      situations, including households and in old people’s and nursing homes. In addition, in many districts
      there is an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2, without traceable transmission chains.
      Currently, however, the number of illnesses among older people is on the rise again. As they more often
      have a severe course due to COVID-19, the number of serious cases and deaths is also increasing. These
      can be avoided if we prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control
      measures.
      It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and
      control, e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating
      indoor spaces and, where indicated, by wearing a community mask correctly. Crowds of people -
      especially indoors - should be avoided.

  Geographical distribution of cases
  Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to the RKI in line with the
  Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily). Since January 2020, a total of 727,553
  (+21,866) laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported to and validated by the RKI
  (Table 1).

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e.g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases
  * There were no cases transmitted today from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset
  of symptoms is unknown for 377,477 cases (52%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.
  Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.

  Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in Germany electronically reported to the RKI by the date of symptoms onset or – if
  unknown – alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (12/11/2020, 12:00 AM).
  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), the RKI receives
  information on occupation, accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for
  reported COVID-19 cases.
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 58% of cases, the
  numbers of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above-mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.
  The number of COVID-19 cases was highest among persons cared for or employed in care facilities
  according to § 36 IfSG, among persons employed in medical facilities according to § 23 IfSG and among
  persons cared for in educational facilities according to § 33 IfSG (Table 2). The number of deaths was
  particularly high among persons cared for in facilities according to §§ 23 and 36.
  Among the cases reported as working in medical facilities (§ 23 IfSG), 74% were female and 26% male.
  Their median age was 40 years. The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various
  care facilities (§ 36 IfSG) is consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes.
  The high number of cases among persons working in the food sector (§ 42 IfSG) is largely due to
  outbreaks in meat processing plants.

  Due to changes in data registration, not all data entries for cases ascertained in the most recent version of the surveillance software could be
  taken into account. This will be corrected in the coming days.
  Outbreaks
  An increased incidence of >25 cases in 7 days/100,000 population was reported for almost every district
  (407 of 412). By now, 269 urban and rural districts have an incidence of over 100 cases/100,000
  population, including 16 districts with an incidence of over 250 cases/100,000 population; additionally,
  99 districts have a 7-day incidence of >50 -100 cases/100,000 population and 35 districts have a 7-day
  incidence of > 25 – 50 cases/100,000 population. The dashboard (https://corona.rki.de) shows all
  affected districts.
  In most districts the transmission is diffuse, with several cases clustering in households. Many small
  outbreaks in retirement and nursing homes, in hospitals and facilities for asylum seekers and refugees,
  and community facilities, kindergartens and schools, various occupational settings and in the context of
  religious gatherings continue to contribute to the increase of incidence.
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
  The estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that
  shows the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for
  the last few days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals
  given for the R-value. After other case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for
  the past days and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at
  the beginning of a week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated
  the real COVID-19 events in Germany. Values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable.
  The currently estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.

  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is
  less affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 12/11/2020, 12 AM, taking into account cases up to 08/11/2020).
  The reported R-values have been stable well above 1 in October. Over the past few days the R-value has
  been fluctuating and is currently below 1. This means that, on average, each person infected with SARS-
  CoV-2 infects another person. As the number of infected persons is currently very high in Germany, this
  means that there is still a high number of new cases every day.

 DIVI intensive care register
     The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in
     collaboration with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as
     well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since
     16/04/2020, all hospitals with intensive care beds are required to report
     (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister).
     As of 12/11/2020, a total of 1,290 hospitals or departments reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 28,517
     intensive care beds were registered, of which 21,930 (77%) are occupied, and 6,587 (23%) are currently
     available. The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 3.

     *The interpretation of these numbers must take into account the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of
     reported patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase
     in the cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
 Information from additional RKI based surveillance
 systems for acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
     (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 45, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) slightly
     decreased. The ARI rate has been below the level of the previous years since week 36, 2020. Further
     information can be found under https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
     practices. In week 45, 2020, the overall number of patients visits due to acute respiratory infections (ARI
     rate) decreased. The ARI rate declined in all age groups. Despite the decline, the overall number of
     patients visits due to ARI was still higher than in previous seasons at this time of the year. Within the
     viral surveillance of the AGI, respiratory viruses were detected in 26 of 52 sentinel samples (50%) in week
     45, 2020. Among those, rhinovirus was identified in 23 samples (44%). SARS-CoV-2 was found in 2 of 51
     analysed samples (4%). No influenza virus was detected. Further information can be found under
     https://influenza.rki.de/.
     A third, ICD-10 code based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). In week 44, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased. The number of

    SARI cases in the age groups above 35 years were at a markedly higher level than in previous years, but
    remained below the usual level for children aged 0 to 14 years. Of all reported SARI cases in week 44,
    2020, 49% were diagnosed with COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (See Figure 4). The proportion of COVID-
    19 infections among SARI cases has increased since week 40, 2020 and has reached a new peak in week
    44, 2020. The proportion of COVID-19 infections among SARI by age groups can be found in Table 4. The
    proportions of COVID-19 cases in age groups 35 to 59 years and 60 years and above were similar in
    spring (week 12 to 20, 2020) and in autumn (week 40 to 43, 2020). In SARI cases of age group 15 to 34
    years, the proportion of COVID-19 cases in autumn has been higher than in spring. COVID-19 infections
    were scarce among hospitalised SARI cases aged below 15 years.
    In week 44, 2020, the proportion of COVID-19 cases was exceptionally high in the age groups 15 years
    and above, comprising at least half of the SARI cases in this week. Please note that due to data
    availability only patients with an ICD-10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration
    of up to one week were included in this analysis.
