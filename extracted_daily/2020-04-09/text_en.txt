  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
      Geographical distribution of cases
      Epidemiological analyses are based on validated cases notified electronically to RKI according to the
      Protection Against Infection Law (Data closure: 12:00 AM daily).
      Since January 2020, a total of 108,202 (+4,974) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 2,107 deaths (see
      Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states.
      Information on confirmed cases are also available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html and

    Germany by county and federal state (09/04/2020, 12:00 AM).
    Please see the COVID-19 dashboard (https://corona.rki.de/) for information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health
    authority).
    Distribution of cases over time
    COVID-19 cases were first notified in Germany in January 2020. In 41,144 cases, onset of symptoms is
    unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see Figure 2).

    Demographic distribution of cases
    Of reported cases, 49% are male and 51% are female. Among notified cases, 855 were children under 5
    years of age, 2,130 children aged 5 to 14 years, 74,926 persons aged 15 to 59 years, 20,925 persons aged
    60 to 79 years and 9,160 persons aged 80 years and older (see Figure 3). The age of 206 notified cases is
    unknown. The median age of cases is 50 years.

    information available (09/04/2020, 12:00 AM)
    Clinical aspects
    Information on symptoms is available for 82,152 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are
    cough (52%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 1,880 cases (2%).
    Hospitalisation was reported for 12,268 (15%) of 82,152 COVID-19 cases with information on
    hospitalisation available.
    Approximately 49,900 persons are estimated to have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. As the
    exact date of recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate the number of
    recovered cases.
    The 2,107 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 1,286 (61%) men and 817 (39%)
    women (sex was unknown in 4 cases). The median age was 82 years and the range 26 to 105 years. Of all
    deaths, 1,819 (86%) were in persons 70 years or older, but only 16% of all cases were in this age group.
    Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the
    number of deaths is relatively high.

  SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers
  Of notified cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least 4,700 were reported among health care staff in
  institutions as defined by §23 of the German Protection Against Infection law (IfSG), such as hospitals,
  outpatient clics and practices, dialysis clinics or outpatient nursing services. Of the notified cases with SARS-
  CoV-2 infection among health care workers, 71% were female and 29% male. The median age was 42 years.

      Estimation of the reproduction number (R0)
      The reproduction number, R0, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R0 can only be estimated
      and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R0= 1.1 (95% confidence
      interval: 0.9-1.4) and is based on current electronically notified cases (09/04/2020 12:00 AM) and an
      assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were
      excluded from the estimation as their low number due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable
      estimate. For more details on the methodology see Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 Online vorab: 9. April 2020

      DIVI intensive care register
      A registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the
      RKI and the German Hospital Federation (DKG) was set up to document the capacities for intensive care
      as well as the number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals:
      https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister .
      As of 09/04/2020, 680 hospitals or departments are reporting (+92 since yesterday) to the registry.
      Migration of the registry to a new server has led to reporting delays, thus comparisons with data prior to
      03/04/2020 are not meaningful. Currently, likely fewer than half of all ICU beds in Germany are captured
      by the registry. A total of 16,734 intensive care beds were registered, of which 9,695 (58%) are occupied
      and 7,039 beds are currently available (Table 3).

      *Due to the changing number of reporting hospitals from day to day this comparison is currently not meaningful
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and
      fatal courses occur in some cases. The number of cases, hospitalisations and fatalities in Germany
      continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall
      as high and as very high for risk groups. The probability of serious disease progression increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses. The risk of disease varies from region to region. The burden on
      the health care system depends on the geographical and age distribution of cases, health care capacity
      and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very
      high in some geographical regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new
      findings.

  Measures taken by Germany
   International risk areas
     -     The following countries and regions are classified as international risk areas (31/03/2020)
           (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete.html):
                o Austria
                o Egypt
                o France
                o Iran
                o Italy
                o Netherlands
                o Spain
                o Switzerland
                o South Korea: the city of Daegu and the province of Gyeongsangbuk-do (North-Gyeongsang)
                o United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
                o United States of America
     Due to pandemic spread, there is a global risk of acquiring COVID-19. Due to differences in surveillance
     systems, test strategies and reporting delays, the risk of infection cannot always be related to reported
     numbers. Therefore, all persons entering Germany are required to remain in quarantine for 14 days.
   Other measures
     -     All arriving travellers in Germany are to remain in quarantine for 14 days:
           https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/neue-einreiseregeln-1739634
     -     RKI teams are currently supporting outbreak containment measures with a focus on outbreaks in
           retirement and health care homes as well as hospitals in several federal states.
     -     Outbreaks are ongoing in many districts, some with high case numbers. Data on current disease
           activity can be found on the dashboard https://corona.rki.de/ and in the daily situation reports.
     -     A new federal law was implemented on 28/03/2020 for the protection of the public in the event of
           epidemic situations, granting the federal government additional competencies for the control of
           epidemics. https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2020/1-
           quartal/corona-gesetzespaket-im-bundesrat.html
     -     As of 23/03/2020, gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and household
           members) are banned in all federal states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with body care
           were closed. In public spaces, all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to other indivduals
