Since 6 March 2021, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has been publishing the English version of the COVID-19
situation reports for Germany on a weekly basis. Information on the daily epidemiological situation is
available on the RKI’s online COVID-19 dashboard. In addition, the RKI’s website provides daily situation
reports in German, information on vaccination data and from the intensive care registry, as well as other
regularly uploaded data. [Information sources at provided at the end of this report].
The following information is provided in this situation report: Overview on the epidemiological situation,
demographic distribution of cases, surveys on laboratory tests of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, and information
from additional RKI-based surveillance systems.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  The age-specific 7-day incidence is shown using a heat map (Figure 1). Age-specific case numbers and age-
  specific 7-day incidences can be accessed through the following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-altersverteilung .

  according to the German Data Protection Act.
  Figure 2 shows the total number of cases with or without COVID-19-relevant symptoms as well as the
  proportion of hospitalised and deceased cases. Since deaths occur on average 2-3 weeks after infection,
  additional reports of deaths are expected for the most recent three weeks. The data used for this figure can

  Information on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests in Germany
      The RKI assesses the number of PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 carried out in Germany on a weekly basis by
      merging data from university hospitals, research institutions as well as clinical and outpatient laboratories
      throughout Germany. These data are shared voluntarily with the RKI from the following sources: An
      internet-based RKI test laboratory survey, the network for respiratory viruses (RespVir), the laboratory-
      based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance established at the RKI (an extension of the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance
      (ARS)), and the enquiry of a professional association of laboratory medicine.
      Table 2 shows the number of tests, the proportion of positive tests, as well as the number of reporting
      laboratories since the start of testing in Germany. Since laboratories can register and correct the tests from
      previous calendar weeks at a later date, it is possible that the ascertained numbers can change
      retrospectively. It should be noted that the number of tests is not the same as the number of people tested,
      since the data may include multiple tests from the same individuals within a time period of a few weeks
      (Table 2). Complete data since the beginning of testing are available through the following link:
      http://www.rki.de/covid-19-testzahlen (in German). The current testing criteria can be found through the
      following link: www.rki.de/covid-19-testkriterien (in German).

 Information from additional RKI-based surveillance
 systems on acute respiratory illnesses
     GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a platform at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness (ARI)
     within the population in Germany. In week 17, 2021, the total ARI rate remained stable. The ARI rate
     decreased in children (0 to 14 years), but increased in adults (15 years and above). Since week 36, 2020, the
     total ARI rate has been lower than in seasons 2017/18 and 2018/19 and is now similar to values seen during
     2019/20. Further information can be found through the following link: https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
     The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel primary care network. In week 17,
     2021, the total number of patient visits (consultations) due to ARI (ARI consultation rate) decreased slightly.
     The total ARI consultation rate decreased in all age groups. Through virological surveillance of the AGI,
     respiratory viruses were detected in 67 of 139 sentinel samples (48%) in week 17, 2021. Among those,
     human seasonal coronavirus (hCoV) was found in 26 (19%) samples, rhinovirus in 23 (17%) samples, SARS-
     CoV-2 in 13 (9%) samples and Parainfluenzavirus was found in seven (5%) samples. Further national and
     regional information can be found through the following links: https://influenza.rki.de/ and
     https://influenza.rki.de/Diagrams.aspx?agiRegion=0.
     A third ICD-10 code-based system monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in newly hospitalised
     patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses of influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
     the lower respiratory tract). The total number of SARI cases increased slightly in week 16, 2021. The number
     of SARI cases in the age groups 15 to 34 years, 35 to 59 years and 60 to 79 years was considerably higher
     than in previous years. Of all reported SARI cases in week 16, 2021, 71% were diagnosed with COVID-19
     (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (Figure 4). Please note that due to data availability, only patients with an ICD-10 Code
     for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in this analysis.

       19 (ICD-10 code U07.1!) among SARI cases with duration of hospitalisation of up to one week and with date of admission in weeks
       12, 2020 to 16, 2021. Data are derived from 71 sentinel hospitals.
    Risk Assessment by the RKI
       In view of persistently high case numbers of COVID-19 the RKI assesses the threat to the health of the
       general population in Germany to be very high. It highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-
       CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of many outbreaks, particularly in households, day-care facilities for
       children and increasingly in schools, as well as in occupational settings.
       In light of the increase in variants of concern (VOC), which have higher infectiousness, a rigorous reduction
       of physical contacts, use of protective measures, as well as intensive efforts to contain outbreaks and chains
       of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect people who are
       vulnerable.
       On 05/05/2021, the risk assessment was updated. The current version can be found through the following
       link: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

  Annex
      1
        The difference to the previous day is based on the date that cases are received by the RKI. Due to delays in
        data sharing, cases from previous days may be included in today’s numbers.
      2
        Active cases were calculated from the number of shared cases minus deaths and the estimated number of
        recovered cases.
      3
        The algorithm for estimating recovered cases takes into account information on disease onset and
        hospitalisation, but does not do so for late effects since these data are not recorded regularly.
