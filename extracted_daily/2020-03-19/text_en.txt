2   COVID-19 Situation Report 19/03/2020
  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
    Case numbers1
      With over 8.000 cases the number of COVID-19-cases can no longer be updated and validated manually.
      Therefore, as of March 17, epidemiological evaluations in the COVID-19 situation report are based only on
      electronically transmitted data available to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at the time of the data closure (0:00
      AM).
      Since 27/01/2020, a total of 10.999 (+2.801) laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      have been electronically reported to and validated at the RKI, including 20 deaths.
      Information on laboratory-confirmed cases
      So far, 10.999 cases in 16 federal states have been laboratory-confirmed and electronically reported (see Table 1
      and Figure 1).
      In addition, diagnosis is ongoing for suspected cases in several federal states. Current figures on confirmed cases
      are available on the RKI website at
      https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html

    Information on electronically reported cases (10.999 cases, 19/03/2020. 0:00 AM)
    10.999 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-cases from all 16 federal states have been electronically reported to the
    Robert Koch Institute (see fig. 1).
    Figure 1: Distribution of the 10.999 electronically reported COVID-19-cases in Germany by county and state (19/03/2020)
    Among these cases. 6.183 are male (56%) and 4.782 female (44%). The age range is from 0 to 98 years, including
    87 children under the age of 5, 266 children aged 5 to 14 years, 8.790 persons aged 15 to 59 years and 1.800
    persons 60 years and older (see Figure 2). The age of 56 notified cases is unknown. The median age is 47 years.

    Known dates of symptom onset ranged from 23/01/2020 through 18/03/2020. In 4.806 cases, onset of
    symptoms is unknown and therefore date of reporting is shown (see fig. 3).

      of symptoms and alternatively by date of reporting (9 cases with missing dates; 19/03/2020)
      Further information
      The 20 COVID-19-related deaths reported in Germany since 09/03/2020 concerned 12 men and 8 women from
      the 3 federal states Northrhine-Westfalia (6). Bavaria (8) and Baden-Wurttemberg (6). All the deceased were
      older than 65 years of age; the mean and median age were both 81 years.
  Assessment by the RKI
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. Severe and fatal
      courses occur in some cases. The number of cases in Germany continues to increase. The RKI currently assesses
      the overall risk to the health of the German population as high. However, this risk varies from region to region.
      The probability of serious disease progression increases with increasing age and existing previous illnesses. The
      burden on the health care system depends on the regional distribution of cases, health care capacity and
      initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, social distancing etc.), and may be very high in some
      regions. This assessment may change on short notice as a result of new findings.
  Measures taken by Germany
    Risk areas and particularly affected areas in Germany
      -     The following regions are classified as particularly affected areas in Germany:
