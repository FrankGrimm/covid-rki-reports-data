     Summary (as of 23/07/2020 12:00 AM)
     •    The cumulative nationwide incidence over the past 7 days was 3.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
          and thus increased slightly at a low level. A total of 98 districts transmitted zero cases. Moreover,
          in 236 districts the 7-day-incidence is below 5,0/100,000 inhabitants.
     •    In total, 203,368 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,101 deaths due to COVID-19 have
          been electronically reported to the RKI in Germany.

  information on number of COVID-19 cases by county (local health authority).
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 2 shows COVID-19 cases transmitted to
  RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of symptoms is
  unknown in 62,091 cases (31%), thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 2.

  Demographic distribution of cases
  Of all reported cases, 52% are female and 48% are male. Among all those notified cases, for which data
  on age and gender were reported, 5,654 were children under 10 years of age (2.8%), 10,285 children
  and teenagers aged 10 to 19 years (5,1%), 90,100 persons aged 20 to 49 years (44%), 60,801 persons
  aged 50 to 69 years (30%), 30,652 persons aged 70 to 89 years (15%) and 5,414 persons aged 90 years
  and older (2.7%). The age and/or gender is unknown in 462 notified cases. The mean age of cases is 48
  years (median age 48 years). The highest incidences are seen in persons aged 90 years and older
  (Figure 3).
  Figure 3: Electronically reported COVID-19 cases/100,000 population in Germany by age group and gender (n=202,900) for
  cases with information available (23/07/2020,12:00 AM).
  Clinical aspects
  Information on symptoms is available for 173,305 (85%) of the notified cases. Common symptoms are
  cough (48%), fever (40%) and rhinorrhoea (21%). Pneumonia was reported in 5,191 cases (3.0%). Since
  calendar week 17, cases are reported to the RKI as a distinct COVID-19 surveillance category. Since then,
  ageusia and anosmia can also be entered as symptoms. At least one of these two symptoms was
  reported in 4,398 of 29,559 cases (15%).
  Hospitalisation was reported for 30,217 (17%) of 177,296 COVID-19 cases with information on
  hospitalisation status.
  Approximately 189,000 people have recovered from their COVID-19 infection. Since the exact date of
  recovery is unknown in most cases, an algorithm was developed to estimate this number.
  In total, 9,101 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in Germany (4.5% of all confirmed cases).
  Of these, 5,030 (55%) are men and 4,066 (45%) are women (see Table 2), the gender was unknown in
  five cases. The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 7,786 (86%) were in people aged 70 years or
  older, but only 18% of all cases were in this age group. So far, three deaths among COVID-19 cases
  under 20 years of age have been reported to the RKI. Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for
  all three.

  Occupation, accommodation or care in facilities
  In accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act, the RKI receives information on occupation,
  accommodation or care in a facility relevant for infection control for reported COVID-19 cases
  Since information on occupation, accommodation or care in these facilities is missing in 25% of cases,
  the proportion of cases working, accommodated or cared for in these facilities reported here should be
  considered minimum values. Among the COVID-19 cases reported from the above mentioned facilities,
  the proportion of cases that actually acquired their infection in these facilities is unknown.

    COVID-19 Situation Report 23/07/2020

    The high number of cases among people cared for or working in various care facilities (Section 36 IfSG) is
    consistent with numerous reported outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. The low number of cases
    among persons who attend or work in facilities providing child care or education (Section 33 IfSG)
    reflects the low number of case in children observed thus far. The increase in the number of cases
    among persons working in the food sector (§42) is largely due to outbreaks in meat processing plants.
    Outbreaks
    A high 7-day incidence with more than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in the district of
    Vechta (Lower Saxony). An accumulation of COVID-19 cases was detected as a result of screening of
    >1,000 employees of a meat processing company. Neighbouring districts are also affected.
    Further COVID-19 outbreaks continue to be reported in nursing homes and hospitals, refugee facilities,
    family events, child-day care facilities as well as religious communities.
    Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
    The presented case numbers do not fully reflect the temporal progression of incident COVID-19-cases,
    since the time intervals between actual onset of illness and diagnosis, reporting, as well as data
    transmission to the RKI vary greatly. Therefore, a nowcasting approach is applied to model the true
    temporal progression of COVID-19 cases according to illness onset. Figure 4 shows the result of this
    analysis.
    The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person.
    R can only be estimated based on statistical analyses such as nowcasting and not directly extracted from
    the notification system.

    A sensitive 4-day-R-value can be estimated by using a 4-day moving average of the number of new cases
    estimated by nowcasting. This 4-day value reflects the infection situation about one to two weeks ago.
    This value reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual
    outbreaks. Furthermore, outbreak dynamics may be influenced widespread testing performed among
    affected persons, leading to therapid detection of many additional COVID-19 cases. This can lead to

        relatively large fluctuations in the estimated R-value, especially if – as is currently the case in
        Germany - the total number of new cases is small.
        The current estimate of the 4-day R-value is 0.93 (95%-prediction interval: 0.77 – 1.13) and is based on
        electronically notified cases as of 23/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
        Similarly, the 7-day R-value is estimated by using a moving 7-day average of the nowcasting curve. This
        compensates for fluctuations more effectively, as this value represents a slightly later course of infection
        of about one to a little over two weeks ago. The 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.05 (95% prediction
        interval: 0.96 – 1.16) and is based on electronically notified cases as of 23/07/2020, 12:00 AM.
        Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting both R-values with daily updates can be found
        under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed methodological explanation of the more stable 7day

          As of 19-07-2020, data from 10 emergency departments have been taken into account. Between 01-11-
          2019 and 01-03-2020, an average of 6,608 emergency department admissions per week was recorded.
          From the middle to the end of March 2020, a 40% decrease in the number of admissions was observed,
          to 3,969 admissions in week 13, 2020. Similar declines were evident in comparable surveillance systems
          in the USA, England and Wales. In parallel to the decrease in daily admissions, public measures were
          taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Subsequently, an increase in admissions has been
          observed. In week 29 2020, 6,259 admissions were recorded. Therefore, the number of admissions is
          currently 5% below the average of November 2019 to February 2020 (see Figure 5).

Information from additional RKI based surveillance
      systems for actue respiratory illnesses
          GrippeWeb (“FluWeb”) is a web interface at RKI for monitoring the activity of acute respiratory illness
          (ARI), utilizing information from the population. In week 29, 2020, the rate of ARI (“ARI rate”) remained
          stable, but increased among children below 5 years of age. Further information can be found under
          https://grippeweb.rki.de/.
          The Influenza Working Group (AGI) monitors ARI through a sentinel network of physicians in private
          practices. In week 29, 2020, the overall number of patient visits due to acute respiratory infections
          decreased slightly, but increased for the age groups 0 to 4 years and 15 to 34 years. Overall, it remained
          at a low level that matches the level of previous season at this time of the year. Within the viral
          surveillance of the AGI, rhinovirus was detected in 23 of 29 samples (79%) in week 29, 2020. Since week
          16, 2020, no SARS-COV-2 has been detected within the viral surveillance of the AGI. Further information
          can be found under https://influenza.rki.de/.

      A third, ICD-10 code based system, monitors severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in hospitalized
      patients (ICD-10 codes J09 to J22: primary diagnoses influenza, pneumonia or other acute infections of
      the lower respiratory tract). In week 28, 2020, the total number of SARI cases increased slightly overall,
      but increased strongly among children below 5 years of age. Overall, the total number of SARI cases
      remained at a low level. Of all reported SARI cases in week 28, 2020, 3% were diagnosed with COVID-19
      (ICD-10 code U07.1!) (See Figure 6). Please note that due to data availability only patients with an ICD-
      10 Code for SARI as the main diagnosis and hospitalisation duration of up to one week were included in
      this analysis.

  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      General assessment
      At the global and the national level, the situation is very dynamic and must be taken seriously. The
      number of newly reported cases has been declining since mid-March. Currently, many districts are
      transmitting very few or no cases to the RKI. The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the
      German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups. This assessment may change at
      short notice based on new insights.
      Infection risk
      The risk of infection depends heavily on the regional spread, living conditions and also on individual
      behaviour, including compliance with physical distancing, hygiene measures and community masks.
      Disease severity
      In most cases, the disease is mild. The probability of progression towards serious disease increases with
      increasing age and underlying illnesses.

     Burden on health system
     The burden on the health care system depends on the geographical distribution of cases, health care
     capacity and initiation of containment measures (isolation, quarantine, physical distancing etc.). The
     burden is currently low in many regions, but may be high in some locations.
