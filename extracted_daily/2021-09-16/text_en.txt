4 COVID-19 situation report as of 16/09/2021
    Sample calculations as well as an excel sheet presenting the daily updated R-value can be retrieved
    under www.rki.de/covid-19-nowcasting. A detailed description of the methodology is available at
    https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/17/Art 02.html (Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 from
    23/04/2020).
    Annex:
    Notes on data collection and evaluation
    The data presented in this situation report represent a snapshot. Information on cases can be obtained
    and added by the health authorities in the course of the disease. It is not possible to obtain complete
    data for all variables.
    If necessary, the local public health departments collect additional information, evaluate reported cases
    and initiate the necessary infection control measures. In accordance with the Infection Protection Act,
    the data are transmitted electronically by the local public health departments to the federal state health
    authority and from there to the RKI on the next working day at the latest. The data is updated at the RKI
    once a day at 0:00 AM.
    Due to the data entry and data transmission, there is a time lag from the time the case is reported to the
    local health department until publication by the RKI, so that there may be deviations with regard to the
    case numbers from other sources.
    For the calculation of the incidences, the data of the population statistics of the Federal Statistical Office
    from 31.12.2020 are used. The calculation of the 7-day incidence is based on the reporting date, i.e. the
    date on which the local health department became aware of the case and recorded it electronically. For
    the 7-day incidence, the cases with a reporting date of the last 7 days are counted.
    The difference from the previous day, on the other hand, as shown in the situation report and
    dashboard, refers to the date when the case is first published in the RKI's reporting. Thus, it may occur
    that, e.g. due to transmission delays, cases with a reporting date more than 7 days ago are still included
    in the situation report. At the same time, the difference from the previous day also takes into account
    cases that were subsequently deleted due to data quality checks, so that the 7-day incidence cannot be
    readily inferred from this difference.
    Notes
    1    The difference from the previous day refers to the date of receipt at the RKI; due to the delay in transmission,
         cases from previous days may be included.
    2    The active cases result from the number of transmitted cases minus the deaths and the estimated number of
         recovered cases.
    3    The algorithm for estimating the number of people who have recovered considers information on the onset of
         the disease and hospitalisation, but not whether there are any late sequelae of the disease, because these
         data are not regularly recorded in the reporting system.
    4    The total number of persons vaccinated at least once includes persons who received initial vaccinations with
         BioNTech, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines or vaccination with Janssen vaccine.
    5    Fully vaccinated against COVID-19 means: two vaccine doses with a vaccine from AstraZeneca, BioNTech,
         Moderna or one dose with the vaccine from Janssen or a single dose in the case of COVID-19 recovered
         patients.
