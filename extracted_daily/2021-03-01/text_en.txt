       COVID-19 cases are notified to the local public health department in the respective districts, in accordance with the German Protection against
       Infection Act (IfSG). The data are further transmitted through the respective federal state health authority to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This
       situation report presents the uniformly recorded nationwide data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases transmitted to RKI. An overview of the
       weekly schedule of topics is available at: www.rki.de/covid-19-en
       – Changes since the last report are marked blue in the text –
       Summary (as of 01/03/2021, 12:00 AM)
       • Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the
           health of the general population to be very high.
       • Yesterday, 4,732 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 60 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were
           transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 66 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence in Berlin, Bremen,
           Hamburg, Saarland and Saxony is slightly, in Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt considerably above the national incidence.
       • In 262 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 56 districts, the 7-day
           incidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in four of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.
       • The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 48 and among the age group ≥80 years 66 cases/100,000 pop.
       • The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
           households, occupational settings as well as nursing and long-term care homes.
       • On 01/03/2021 (12:15 PM) 2,869 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +350 existing patients
           had been discharged (37% of whom had died) and +379 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under
           treatment was 29 more than the prior day.

  COVID-19 Situation Report 01/03/2021

  Epidemiological Situation in Germany
  In accordance with the international standards of WHO 1 and ECDC², the RKI classifies all cases of laboratory
  confirmation via SARS-CoV-2-nucleic acid based (e.g. PCR) detection or SARS-CoV-2 isolation as COVID-19
  cases, regardless of the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, in the following report the term
  "COVID-19 cases" covers acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as cases of COVID-19 disease.
  General current assessment
  At the moment, there is an increase in the number of cases.
  The 7-day R-value is currently around 1. Due to the occurrence of different virus variants (see below) there
  is an increased risk of a renewed stronger increase in the number of cases.
  Outbreaks are being reported from various districts throughout Germany, currently particularly in nursing
  and long-term care homes, occupational settings, and households. Additionally, in many districts, there is
  an increasingly diffuse spread of SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.
  Since patients in older age groups more often suffer from more severe illness due to COVID-19, the number
  of serious cases and deaths remains at a high level. These can only be avoided if all persons prevent the
  spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the help of infection control measures.
  It is therefore still necessary for the entire population to be committed to infection prevention and control,
  e.g. by consistently observing rules of distance and hygiene - also outdoors -, by ventilating indoor spaces
  and, where indicated, by correctly wearing a surgical mask or FFP2 mask (or N95 or KN95 respectively).
  Crowds of people - especially indoors - should be avoided.
  Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being detected worldwide. Since mid-December 2020 there
  have been reports of the increasing spread of a new virus variant (B.1.1.7) in the United Kingdom. There is
  increasing clinical-diagnostic as well as epidemiological evidence of increased infectiousness of this variant.
  Additionally, there are initial indications from the United Kingdom that infections with variant B.1.1.7 may
  lead to more severe diseases. Moreover, in December 2020, an increased occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2
  variant in South Africa (B.1.351) was reported, which has displaced other variants. Therefore, an increased
  infectiousness is conceivable. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that the efficacy of the licensed mRNA
  vaccines is apparently not substantially affected by the variants B.1.1.7. and B.1.351. Additionally, a SARS-
  CoV-2 variant derived from line B.1.1.28 is circulating in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Non-essential
  travel should be avoided – especially due to the circulation of variants of concern.
  All three variants have already been detected in Germany. With increased sequencing and data acquisition
  in the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH – www.rki.de/covid-19-desh ) the infection process is
  increasingly monitored through integrated molecular surveillance.

  Quality checks and data cleaning by the health authorities and regional offices can lead to corrections to cases previously
  transmitted (e. g. detection of duplicate reports). This can occasionally lead to negative values for the number of new cases.
  Distribution of cases over time
  The first COVID-19 cases in Germany were notified in January 2020. Figure 1 shows COVID-19 cases
  transmitted to RKI according to date of illness onset from 01/03/2020 onwards. Of these cases, the onset of
  symptoms is unknown for 1,214,326 cases (50%) thus their date of reporting is provided in Figure 1.

  alternatively by date of reporting since 01/03/2020 (01/03/2021, 12:00 AM).
  Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
  The reproduction number, R, is defined as the mean number of people infected by one infected person. The
  estimation of the R-value is based on the so-called nowcasting (Figure 2), a statistical procedure that shows
  the development of the number of cases after the onset of the disease and also forecasts it for the last few
  days. This forecast is subject to uncertainty, which is also reflected in the prediction intervals given for the
  R-value. After further case reports have been received at the RKI, the R-value is adjusted for the past days
  and, if necessary, corrected upwards or downwards. In recent weeks, values reported at the beginning of a
  week were typically corrected slightly upwards. They had thus slightly underestimated the real COVID-19
  events in Germany, while values estimated towards the end of a week were more stable. The currently
  estimated course of the R-value is shown in Figure 3.
                          4-day R-value                                                   7-day R-value
                                1.10                                                            1.01
         (95%-prediction interval: 0.96 – 1.24)                            (95%-prediction interval: 0.95 – 1.09)
  Delays in reporting of case numbers at weekend days can lead to cyclical fluctuations of the 4-day R-value. The 7-day R-value is less
  affected because all week days are used to determine the value.

  COVID-19 cases according to illness onset (as of 01/03/2021, 12 AM, considering cases up to 25/02/2021).
  The 7-day R-value is currently around 1. Due to the occurrence of different virus variants (see below) there
  is an increased risk of a renewed stronger increase in the number of cases.

  DIVI intensive care register
      The German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) has in collaboration
      with RKI established a registry to document the number of available intensive care beds as well as the
      number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals on a daily basis. Since 16/04/2020, all hospitals
      with intensive care beds are required to report (https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index).
      As of 01/03/2021, a total of 1,280 hospitals reported to the DIVI registry. Overall, 26,801 intensive care
      beds were registered, of which 21,713 (81%) are occupied, and 5,088 (19%) beds are currently available.
      The number of COVID-19 cases treated in participating hospitals is shown in Table 2.

      *The interpretation of these numbers must consider the number of reporting hospitals and therefore the number of reported
      patients may change from day to day. On certain days, this can explain an occasionally important decrease or increase in the
      cumulative number of discharged patients or deaths compared with the day before.
  Risk Assessment by the RKI
      In view of persistently high case numbers, the RKI currently assesses the threat to the health of the general
      population to be very high. The revised version highlights the ongoing community transmission of SARS-
      CoV-2 as well as the occurrence of outbreaks especially in nursing and senior care homes, households, and
      occupational settings.
      Against the background of rising occurrence of variants of concern (VOC) with higher infectiousness, a
      rigorous reduction of physical contacts, usage of protective measures as well as intensive efforts to contain
      outbreaks and chains of infections are necessary to reduce the number of new infections and to protect
      vulnerable persons.
      On 26/02/2021, the risk assessment was updated with reference to the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The
      current version can be found here: http://www.rki.de/covid-19-risikobewertung (in German).

  Annex
     1
       The difference to the previous day is based on the date cases are received at RKI. Due to delay in data
       transmission, cases from preceding days may be included.
     2
       Active cases were calculated from the number of transmitted cases minus deaths and the estimated
       number of recovered cases.
     3
       The algorithm for estimation of recovered cases considers information on disease onset and
       hospitalization, but not for late effects, because such data are not recorded regularly.
     4
       Data on COVID-19 vaccinations are only updated on weekdays. On Sundays, updated figures are not
       reported.
     Note: The report is a snapshot and is continuously updated.
